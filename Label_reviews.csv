,"Childrens, Picture Books, Fantasy, Dragons",Kaitlin,"* I was sent this for free by the publisher *
This book has been one I've been waiting for for quite some time. It's by the lovely Jen Campbell and illustrated by the EQUALLY talented Katie Harnett.
We follow the adventures of a dragon (already the best character you can choose) and a young girl who try to set up a bookshop on Franklin's back. It's quite a lovely tale, and filled with added delights of colour, form and
 beauty. The words and images compliment one another beautifully, and I know all the children in my family will adore it (so I will be reading it to them!)
A wonderful and beautiful story. Fantastic for kids, and a book I would recommend to any fantasy or art-lover too. 5*s (less)",Positif
,"Romance, Contemporary, New Adult, Contemporary Romance, Did Not Finish",Jenny Vee ~The Review Loft~,"I wanted to like this story, I really did. Unfortunately for me, I didnâ€™t like any of the characters and it is plagued by inconsistencies. Iâ€™ll admit, I teared up while reading it, Iâ€™m not soulless after all, but I wasnâ€™t able to 
allow my emotions to shield me from the structure and content issues. Ignorance would have been bliss.
Iâ€™m not going to summarize the story for you because thereâ€™s a perfectly fine synopsis here on Goodreads. If you donâ€™t want spoilers of any sort, stop reading now.
How can someone as dense as Charlotte be so spontaneously insightful at times? Charlotte often comes across as naÃ¯ve or selfish (admittedly) but then sheâ€™ll have these moments of profound wisdom that just doesnâ€™t jive 
with how she is portrayed for most of the story. Iâ€™m also not comfortable with the fact that she seemingly has unprotected sex with two men within a short amount of time, mainly because she doesnâ€™t inquire about their health status.
 Risky sex for the sake ofâ€¦whatever you want to call it, doesnâ€™t fly with me. Iâ€™m not factoring it into my rating but wanted to mention it because it bugs me.
Sethâ€¦oh, Seth. Seth is a douche bag, not a hero. Heâ€™s like a less-severe Jekyll and Hyde. He forces himself on Charlotte, makes her feel bad about wanting to wait to have sex, and weâ€™re supposed to find him attractive? At 
one point he says, â€œI want you and Iâ€™m tired of waiting.â€ He gets quite pushy about it. Heâ€™s domineering and controlling one minute and then sweet and unconditionally understanding the next. No thank you, Iâ€™ll pass.
Both Seth and Alex tell us why Charlotte is so great, kind, funny, thoughtful, etc., but we donâ€™t really see much of it. We see an immature girl stuck in her own head who canâ€™t commit to anyone but her best friend. We donâ€™t see 
these moments of â€œAwesome Charlotteâ€ and thatâ€™s too bad; it feels like a big missed opportunity. I believe it is Seth who says, â€œI can tell youâ€™re smart and savvy and know a lot of things about the worldâ€ but we never 
see anything to back that up, especially the worldly bit. There are two big pet peeves here: Telling instead of showing, and a female author writing what women â€œwantâ€ to hear in order to induce swooning instead of how men talk. 
Real-life men are perfectly capable of saying wonderful things, and Iâ€™m not selling them short, but this book reads like a woman talking and I donâ€™t appreciate that. Both male leads are inauthentic because of these things.
I could honestly keep going like this for far too long but that would be silly. Overall, I found Wish You Were Here to be inauthentic, inconsistent in regard to events discussed versus what we witness (Adam is weak and dying but can 
manage to move his wheelchair by himself with Charlotte on his lap?), and a whole lot of telling instead of showing. If you can allow your emotions to pull the shade over these things, by all means, pick up this book. There have been 
plenty of times Iâ€™ve been able to manage that and have been blissfully unaware. I just couldnâ€™t block the bad out this time. This book will tug on heartstrings if you have them and probably make you tear up. Just donâ€™t expect 
great structure or storytelling. Many people (a ton, really) have loved this story so the odds are, you will, too. (less)",Netral
,"Romance, M M Romance, Contemporary",Sandra,"MINE!!!
This was a fun romp. I enjoyed reading it, even if the characters are a bit of a stereotype, what with the washboard abs, the massive dicks (except for the bad guy; his dick is reportedly on the smaller side), the super-toned bods, 
and the fact that nearly everyone in this mostly fictional condo building just north of downtown Atlanta is gay and most of them fuck indiscriminately but safely. Wheeeee, they're young, they're hung, and they're having a good time.
There is lots and lots of steamy sexy times in this book too, and it would be very easy to dismiss it as just another stereotypical erotic romance BUT the two main characters actually do struggle to make sense of their lives and
 themselves. They do have feelings, they feel hurt and pain and grief, joy and happiness and heartbreak, and while they don't always make the best choices, they do try to get it right.
What begins as a fake relationship with hot sex turns into much more, even if there are roadblocks and fears. If you can look past the first person present tense and superficial descriptions of the hot bods all around, there is
 actually a sweet romance within.
I enjoyed it. YMMV. (less)",Positif
,"Nonfiction, Psychology, Science, Technology, Business",Cat,"I just finished reading the book Irresistible by Adam Alter. This book looks at our addiction to technology (smartphones, email, gaming, fitness tracking, etc). It starts by reviewing the research on behavioural addiction (what it is and where it came from), 
how to create addictive experiences, and solutions for living in a world where abstinence from technology isn't an option. It's different than the other UX books I've read in that it made me think about the ethics of creating addictive user interfaces and 
what responsibilities we have as designers of these products. Here are the notes I took as I was reading:
Addiction is a deep attachment to an experience that is harmful and difficult to do without. Rather than involving substances, behavioral addictions arise when a person can't resist a behavior which addresses a deep psychological need in the short term, 
but produces significant harm in the long term.
Research on rats demonstrated that anyone can exhibit addiction under the right circumstances and it isn't just based on having an addictive personality - eg a probe activating pleasure centre causes rats to ignore food and rest, but when taken out of that 
environment they no longer show addictive behaviors. This was revolutionary compared to the idea that addicts have brains that are predisposed to substance abuse.
Ingredients of an addictive experience: goals, feedback, progress, escalation, cliffhangers, and social interaction.
Humans are driven by a sense of progress. When goals are smaller and easier to manage, people will be more likely to act. Goals inspire action because they become fixation points. The problem occurs when people start fixating on arbitrary goals, like 
getting to inbox zero, where we become obsessed with perfection and spend more time pursuing the goal than enjoying the success. If the pursuit is governed by numbers (eg salary, Instagram followers, marathon time, streaks), goals will come in the form 
of round numbers and social comparisons, and repeated success will spawn one new ambitious goal after another.
Feedback encourages action, whether it be pushing a button on an elevator or even a virtual button that does nothing (eg Reddit's 2015 April Fools prank). When feedback is intermittent rather than guaranteed, more dopamine is released in the brain for each 
""reward"" and the draw is bigger (like gambling). Facebook took advantage of this phenomenon via their like button, which gives intermittent feedback about whether your friends like your post. In gambling with slot machines, losses can be disguised as wins when
 you win back some of the money you spent on a spin (eg win 1 of 15 rows on a single spin would get you $1 win, but cost $1.50 to play). The alluring whirl of lights and sounds can convince you that you won. Similarly to how slot machines measure success using
 time on device, game designers capture how engaging and enjoyable their games are. Designers use microfeedback to keep gamers hooked. It is important that feedback immediately follows a player's action so the player feels they caused it. Games like Candy Crush 
use a layer of surface feedback, like sights and sounds, to make it feel real and connect the player to the virtual world. Virtual Reality has the potential to deepen this experience and escalate behavioural addictions.
Addictive games help users progress and offer something to both novices and experts. Start with a hook, like the dollar auction game or Super Mario avatar setup. Beginner's luck can also be a powerful hook because it shows you the pleasure of success and then yanks
 it away. In gaming, this can be achieved by giving rewards quickly early in the game and spreading them out as the player progresses.
Although people think they want to make life easier, there is actually research showing people prefer breaks between something pleasant and moderate hardship (examples of people in the lab giving themselves electric shocks to avoid the boredom of sitting alone with 
their thoughts for 20 minutes, and movie stars getting bored with everything coming too easily). Escalation of difficulty is a critical hook that keeps games engaging long after you've mastered the basic moves - like Tetris getting faster as you progress with time. Another 
study showed that children learn best and are most motivated when the material they're learning is just beyond their current skill level - called the ""zone of proximal development"". When people enter the zone, they experience ""flow"" - the joy of being able to just barely 
overcome challenges. In the context of gaming, this sensation is called a ""ludic loop"" where each time you solve part of the puzzle a new incomplete piece presents itself - e.g. Super Hexagon starts up again right away so the player can't wallow in defeat, music starts at 
random spot so it doesn't feel like as much of a loss - all to preserve the player's flow. Near wins where you're sure you were close to winning are very addictive, sometimes more so than actual wins - eg lottery tickets. People have inherent stopping rules that cue them to 
stop doing some activity (shopping, exercising, etc). We tend to overlook them because in the short term it's more useful to know how to get someone to start doing something than to continue or stop doing it. Unfortunately technology can disrupt stopping rules and make
 us less intuitive about what we're doing (eg calorie counting vs healthy eating). Games like Farmville override stopping rules because they are persistently running, with no levels or sessions that tell you when your game begins and ends.
Incomplete experiences occupy our minds more than completed ones - such as tasks and songs. We can use cliffhangers to drive behaviour - eg Netflix autoplay function encourages binge watching, organ donation rates affected based on whether people opt in or opt out.
People are endlessly driven to compare themselves to others. Facebook and Instagram are addictive partly because of the feedback that comes in through likes and comments; something that isn't available through apps without a social network. People also seek social 
confirmation - signs that they see the world the way others do, that they are part of a group. E.g. Hot or Not app gives people feedback about whether their version of hot is mirrored by others. Multiplayer games leverage interactions between gamers who share a common
 purpose to keep people hooked. Making online friends isn't a problem as long as you also make friends in the real world. One study found that gamers aged 10-15 who played 3+ hours/day were less satisfied with their lives, less likely to feel empathy toward other people, 
and less likely to know how to deal with their emotions appropriately. This is especially alarming when recent studies show kids spend an average of 5-7 hours/day in front of screens.
Children are especially vulnerable to addiction because they lack the self control that prevents many adults from developing addictive habits. Hardship innoculation is the idea that struggling with a mental puzzle innoculates you against future mental hardships 
(like vaccines against illness), so depriving kids by handing them a device that makes everything easier is dangerous. Since some screen time is unavoidable, recommendations for healthy screen time include: parents should encourage children to connect what they see
 in the screen world to their experience in the real world (""transfer of learning""), active engagement is better than passive viewing, screen time should focus on the content of the app rather than the technology itself. A key idea is that it's easier to prevent people from 
developing addictions than to correct existing bad habits. Part of parenting today include lessons on how to interact with technology and for how long each day.
When people try to suppress thoughts or behaviors, they tend to focus on them more. Rather than trying to use willpower alone, it is a better habit to reduce the environmental cues. A key to overcoming addictive behaviors is to replace them with something else 
(eg a stress ball instead of biting nails). Habits consist of three parts - a cue, a routine, and a reward. Keep the cue and reward the same, but change the routine. Habits can take a long time to form - 66 days on average, but quite variable across different people.
 Behavioural architecture - redesign your environment so temptations are as close to absent as possible (eg not keeping phone next to you all the time or while sleeping, automatically deleting emails while on vacation, etc) and blunt temptations that can't be avoided.
Not all addictive experiences are bad. The same hooks that drive addiction can also be used to drive healthier eating, regular exercise, retirement savings, charitable giving, and committed studying. Gamification is about taking a non-game experience and turning
 it into a game. Three common elements include using points, badges, and leaderboards. The risk of gamifying everything is that people can lose the intrinsic motivation to do the right thing - only exercising when it's fun, fees for picking up kids late from daycare become an economic decision, etc. (less)",Positif

,"Mystery, Thriller, Crime, Fiction",Norma * Traveling Sister,"Traveling Sisters Group Read - thank you sisters for another wonderful reading experience!
ROBERT BRYNDZA is back with another installment to the Detective Erika Foster Series! When I first found out that DI Erika Foster was back with another installment to this series I quickly requested a copy of this book as I am a huge fan of this series! I have enjoyed all of the other previous books in this series and this was no exception.
COLD BLOOD (Detective Erika Foster, #5) by ROBERT BRYNDZA is an action-packed, dark, chilling, and a gripping police procedural thriller that once again pulled me in right away into this edgier, disturbing, and bolder storyline which worked for this Twisted Sister.
ROBERT BRYNDZA delivers another well-written read here with non-stop action, although some things in this storyline is a little on the graphic and gruesome side, I found the storyline quite intriguing and creepy. The story is told in multiple perspectives alternating between the present day investigation from Erikaâ€™s point of view, through journal entries from the point of view into the background of our serial killers lives, and then into a parallel storyline bringing the case and both stories together in the end.
I absolutely love Erika Fosterâ€™s character and found myself a little bit disappointed and irritated with some of the events that her character went through within this book. I really would like to see a little more happiness for Erika in her personal life!
To sum it all up it was an entertaining, exciting, tense, fast-paced, and a quick read with a satisfying ending. Would recommend!!
Thank you to NetGalley, Bookouture, and Robert Bryndza for the opportunity to read an advance copy of this book for a fair and honest review.

,"Mystery, Fiction, Paranormal, Ghosts, American, Southern ",Michelle,"Review can be found on my blog here: https://booksonthebookshelf.wordpress...
This is a paranormal book that follows the life of the main character Melanie. She is about to return to work at a realty office as a realtor after being off work on an extended maternity leave. She has been getting phone calls, that when she picks up the phone there appears to be no one on the other end, and she fears that the ghostly apparitions that have remained silent for a year have returned.
She is tasked with selling a home for a woman named Jayne, who has inherited the house and wants to sell it. The house appears to be haunted by ghosts and spirits inside. Why is the house haunted?
This was the first book I have read by Karen White and although this book is part of a series, none of which I have read previously, it was not hard to keep up with what was going on in the storyline. After reading this book I am definitely interested in reading the other books in this series.
I enjoyed the storyline in this book and I loved the haunted, paranormal feel of the book. The book was written in a way to keep the reader interested from beginning to end. I found myself wanting to know what would happen next as I continued reading along and quite enjoyed reading about the various characters you meet in the book.
Why do there appear to be spirits nearby? What do they want?

,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Did Not Finish, Magic, Fiction",Montzalee Wittmann,"The Waking Land by Callie Bates is a book I was allowed to read from NetGalley and I am so glad indeed! This book is so rich in fantasy, world building, character depth, plot, and twists that I was totally enthralled in its wonders. Elanna has earth magic, more than anyone knows, in a time that magic is forbidden except in the far north where the land shifts and protects the people, the old ways, and the land itself. Elanna is forced/kidnapped from her family as a young child and is held by the King to make her father be submissive to the King. She is raised by the King and told so many lies about her birth land that she believes them. Then, the King is murdered and she is blamed. The daughter of the King is now Queen and has always hated her. Elanna meets a man that also knows magic and knows about hers but he wants her to go to her real father and she believes all the lies. It is so action packed, so many twists, so much magic mixed in there, so much emotion...I am not doing it justice here and only touching on the tip of the iceberg. The Queen's men are after her, the witch hunters are after her...She has the power of the land, earth, and things of the earth. She will need all of these if she can get the land to wake up. It is so exciting to see how and when and with who ....so excellent!!! (less)",Positif
,"Science Fiction, Fiction, Fantasy, Novella",Kaitlin,"I have to say I'm really sad I don't love this series as much as some people do. I remember reading the first one in the series a while back and liking it, but still not getting the hype a lot of my friends were giving it. Going back into Binti's world, I still don't get the hype.
What I do like about this series is that it's showing a female character who I think is pretty great and stands out from her Himba people in positive ways. She is trying to change things and show that you don't have to just settle, you can go for your dreams, and I think that's a great message.
Alongside the human character of Binti we have the alien characters in the book who show something different, like the un-gendered Meduse, and I think that's really nice to see in more books and is definitely a step in the right direction for Sci Fi as a whole.
Unfortunately, for me, plot and characters are really key to my enjoyment of a book and this storyline just didn't capture my attention the way I wanted. I think Binti is doing good things, but I just find her a bit of a boring character to read about even so, and I find her really hard to connect to which is a shame. I really do wish the story worked more for me, but I just can't help but think that in 160+ pages we actually don't do a lot, and I felt that I didn't really feel any intense emotion at all through the book.
Clearly, Okorafor's writing is modern and challenging at times, but for me it just isn't working out (I've previously also read Lagoon by her). I would give this a 2*s overall, it's okay, but I can't see why there's all the love this series gets, but maybe that's just me :) (less)",Negatif

I do not have the words to say how amazing this book is, honestly 5000 stars would not be a high enough rating! If you enjoyed Burn for Me you aren't even going to know what to do with yourself after you finish White Hot, it left me absolutely desperate for Wildfire so its a very good job that they're being released so close together.
I loved every single minute of this story, the chemistry between Rogan and Nevada blows my mind, let's face it EVERYTHING about Rogan hits my hot spots - there wasn't a scene with him in it that didn't have me swooning and fanning myself! He's an intense, brooding, full on alpha male who is as hot as Hades and has a slightly vulnerable squishy centre that you only spot if you look hard enough.
The world building was great before but OMG there is so much more to discover in this book, about the different kinds of magic, about Nevada's abilities and her family history, about the crazy magical creatures that can be pulled out of the arcana and even about the way the different Houses handle their disputes. I have to say that Ilona & Gordon Andrews write the BEST female characters and families you'll ever come across. Nevada is so strong and kickass but she still has a lot to learn about herself and her magic and I love getting to discover what she's capable of right alongside her. Her sisters and cousins get their chance to shine in this book and I'm really curious to find out more about all of their different magical abilities in the future. I also loved the addition of Cornelius to the main cast of characters, his animal sidekicks are wonderful and the ninja ferrets are utterly priceless.
White Hot has everything you could hope for: fun family banter, amazing chemistry between Nevada and Rogan, enemies who always seem to be one step ahead and who are willing to pull out all the stops to hurt our heroes. You'll be shocked one moment and swooning the next only to be watching in terror seconds later as you worry that all your favourite characters might not survive their latest adventure. One thing I guarantee is that you'll want to go back to the first page and start all over again the minute you finish it. I've already read it FIVE times and it's not even been published yet! I think it's safe to say that I'm addicted to this series, Ilona and Gordon were already my favourite authors but this series takes them to a whole new level and my obsession knows no bounds.
I'll leave you with a couple of my favourite quotes just to whet your appetite further:
A tall man was striding from the far end of the hallway. He wore the black robe and it flared around him, the wings of a raven about to take flight. He walked like he owned the building and he'd spotted an intruder in his domain. Magic boiled around him, vicious and lethal, so potent I could feel it from 30 yards away. He wasn't a man, he was an elemental force, a thunderstorm clad in black about to unleash its fury.
and
I finally understood why he was called Mad Rogan. It wasn't because he was insane. It was because he drove you nuts with sheer frustration.

Before reading
OMG OMG OMG OMG I HAVE WHITE HOT!!!!! It's on Edelweiss peeps, go and request it now!
I am crazy excited about this one and can't bloody wait to start it but I have a review copy of the new Innkeeper book to read first then I need to reread Burn For Me again (and no I don't care that I only read it a month ago!) but after that White Hot is going straight to the top of my TBR pile. I'm going to be in Ilona Andrews HEAVEN this weekend but I pity any books I try to read after this bunch of awesomeness LOL. I suspect a reading slump will be hitting next week!

1st read
It's not often a book comes along that is so amazing that the minute you finish it you find yourself having to reread the entire series again. Considering I've literally just binge read Burn for Me and White hot in the last 2 days the fact that I already started Burn for Me AGAIN says it all really!

2nd Read
No that's not a typo, I really did read both this book AND Burn For Me twice each in about 5 days LOL. That's how much I love this series - I am totally addicted and Rogan IS MINE!!
It's far too early to write a full review so I'll post more nearer to the release date but I'm fully expecting to have read it at least another 5 times by next May LOL

,"Fiction, Literary Fiction, Contemporary, Young Adult, Coming Of Age, Adult Fiction",Jenna,"The moment I finished this book, I rushed back to the library to return it so that another of my fellow Denizens of the Eternal Waitlist could have a chance to read it ASAP. Northern Virginia Readers: Youâ€™re Welcome.
As many others have described, this is not a perfect book; it ambitiously tackles a number of weighty themes and integrates various plotlines and time jumps within a relatively modest page count. So, I cannot protest too much other readersâ€™ objections that the book occasionally meanders in a way that some may find difficult to track, and that some plotlines and characters could perhaps be whittled down a bit. But for me, this bookâ€™s perhaps occasional meanderings still made sense, in the way that a walk in the woods makes sense. The book powerfully â€“ and with beautifully skilled writing that reviews have also consistently noted â€“ explores themes including, but certainly not limited to, the idea of â€œNature, red in tooth and claw,â€ the inevitable and often brutal cycles of nature in which humans also participate.
No longer having the book on hand, I canâ€™t quote exactly, but at one point in the novel, protagonist Linda, who lives in rusticity and poverty in rural Northern Minnesota, reflects that outsiders often marvel that isnâ€™t she scared to live so deeply within the isolated severity of the often dark and frozen woods? No she isnâ€™t, Linda muses, because, and Iâ€™m paraphrasing here, the woods are predictable in a way that the human world isnâ€™t. The threats and gifts, the danger and beauty they offer, are cyclical and knowable; one may prepare through observation and thus survive. The rules are constant, unchanging, in stark contrast to the unpredictable violence that humans may inflict upon one another, as demonstrated by a number of the bookâ€™s subplots, most notably the story of the city folk neighbors with whom Linda becomes acquainted, the Gardners, an invasive species that encroaches upon the lake in the woods and upsets its, and Lindaâ€™s, balance.
Through the story of the Gardners, author Fridlund explores an idea that Linda considers more prosaically in the book as â€œthe difference between what people think and what they doâ€ â€“ that is, the hostility that can result and the havoc that can be wrought when humans adopt and blindly follow an ideology (follow an UNnatural human-created set of laws as though it IS nature) to its most extreme ends. Again, the book contains various examples of people doing this, but the most notable examples result in a phenomenon that doesnâ€™t really have an equivalent in nature: neglect, specifically, child neglect, or neglect of a vulnerable life for which one is responsible - and including failure through neglect to protect children from both the ideas and intentions of man and the laws of nature alike.
Both Linda, as the left-behind relic of her hippie parental surrogatesâ€™ commune experiment, and young Paul Gardner, who becomes Lindaâ€™s babysitting charge and whose parents strictly adhere to their own set of ideals by which he is significantly affected, are survivors/victims of profound neglect whose childhood stories unfold in a parallel way throughout the book. For me, this bookâ€™s major accomplishment, and an endeavor in which its grand ambition is fully borne out, is its exploration of childhood neglect, the coping skills and repercussions it engenders, and how these consequences extend through generations and impact the lives of others.
For me, a marvelous and highly original exploration of an important theme, gorgeously written, beautifully observed, with lush and fluid yet meticulous descriptions of setting and character. I do hope others appreciate this book as much as I did, and I cannot wait to see what treasures this author may offer us in the future. (less)",Positif

So, I was super excited to see that the author wrote another book in the series! As soon as I learned another book would be released, I searched NetGalley to try to get an ARC and lucked out! I had my doubts, since it was scheduled to be released in a couple of weeks.
This book starts out 10 months after The War of the River, and it incorporates all the major-ish payers that have now become legends throughout the territories.
I â™¥ â™¥ â™¥ the characters in this book and how it shifts from different POVs! I especially liked reading from Szarok's POV.
I had almost forgot how much I loved the Razorland series, and I definitely had no idea that I would get the chance to read about what happened in the aftermath of Horde from someone else's POV. I am SO glad I got to read this book!
This book was AWESOME! Since I â™¥ed the other Razorland books so much, I definitely has SUPER HIGH expectations for this book, and it exceeded them! I was hooked immediately and couldn't wait to see what happened next, throughout the whole book!
This book was so great! It was like nothing I've ever read, and there was absolutely nothing that I did not love about it!
As always, the author kept up the great writing and world building that was in the other three Razorland book.
When I finished The Great Library series, I was so upset that I would have to wait to read the rest of the books int he series.
I want to say more about this book, but I cant say more about the things that I â™¥ed withouth giving away some big spoilers... So, I'll just stick with saying that I â™¥ed EVERYTHING about this book!
If you haven't read the Razorland series, I definitely encourage you to start! The first three books are absolutely amazing, and this book was no exception!

,"Young Adult, Mystery, Contemporary, Fiction ",Ricky,"I'll give this book four stars if only because of Theo and Jude - a terrific narrator and a terrific Stiles, and even better, a Stiles they actually, on the page, write as openly bi rather than leaving it ambiguous and up to our headcanons. 
Sasha deserves mention too, because she's a very complicated character, much more so than I tend to expect Patterson to deliver. Though maybe that's his cowriter Emily Raymond's hand at work. Overall, this story is a longer one than it should be, 
and a little repetitive too, but the character dynamics are the saving grace. That said, though, I'm obligated to give you some trigger warnings for suicide, rape, and parental abuse - and the last two, especially, take those warnings seriously. The ending 
of this book made me more than a little queasy, especially since this isn't the first Patterson YA book to include it this year alone. (less)",Positif
,"Fantasy, Fiction ",Bookwraiths,"Originally reviewed at Bookwraiths.
Few series transcend their genre, bring readers of differing tastes together to brave dangers along behind its heroes. But when one does, this saga finds itself held up as an all-time great; descriptive terms such as the matchless, the peerless, the unparalleled pinnacle of the genre, and other even more flowery terms thrown around. At the end of the day though, what brands a series as a timeless classic is how it is remembered going forward, especially how many of its fans continue to recommend it to new reader for years and decades to come. Sebastien de Castellâ€™s Greatcoats series now among that small, heralded group of fantasy sagas for me personally. Tyrantâ€™s Throne delivering the finishing touches to propel it into the best swashbuckling fantasy ever written; Falcio val Mond and comrades able to proudly parade among the elites of the genre. And I for one will be trumpeting its praises for as long as I draw breath.
As the concluding chapter in the Greatcoats series, Tyrantâ€™s Throne immediately takes off with the daring do, wisecracking laughs and twisted, political machinations it has become known for. The wedding of two Tristian royals lending itself to yet another rousing dose of Castell action with our leading man pronouncing proudly the most memorable lines since Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride:
My name, your lordship, is Falcio val Mond. . . I am the First Cantor of the Greatcoats, also called the Kingâ€™s Heart. You might not know it yet . . . but you are having a very bad day.
As our viewpoint character, Falcio Val Mond has guided readers from the grim depths of Traitor's Blades through the frantic trials of Knight's Shadow to the gloomy despair of Saint's Blood. His constant soul searching, self-induced delusions, unflinching devotion, and unfailing determination the constant pole around which the seething pool of vile politics, horrid sacrifices, and grim deeds revolve in the quest to place King Paelisâ€™ daughter Aline on the throne of Tristia. Yet, now, when he is so close to completing his last mission for his beloved king, circumstances grow even worse for Falcio.
First, there is a war brewing with the Avareans. Second, there is a final showdown with the horrible Trin, who has done nothing but torment our hero at every turn. And, third, Falcio finds any unexpected enemy â€” his own self. His demons come to torment him; his most cherished memories turned into horrid illusions of the truth; the very foundation of his life as a Greatcoat rocked by the revelations he must confront. The terrible spiraling of events and choices threatening to send our hero into an abyss of despair from which even he cannot ascend.
But as always, Falcio is not cowed by any threat. His single-minded faith in his beloved ideals causing him to move ever forward, even when he makes terrible mistakes. Our hero able to stand proudly before his innumerable, more powerful foes at the worst of moments and flippantly declare, â€œEveryone hush now . . . Iâ€™m about to be impressive.â€
And he is. No matter the trial, the grief, the torment, or the disillusion, Falcio val Mond is a man of ideal, a warrior of principle, who will not give in to the forces dragging him down. He is the Kingâ€™s Heart, and such a man can never be defeated!
I have to say I really didnâ€™t believe there was anything left for Sebastien de Castell to throw at Falcio after three books. He has been tortured (mentally and emotionally), seen his dreams shattered more than a few times, and faced the death of all he loved seemingly at every turn. But I was wrong yet again, for Tyrantâ€™s Throne plunges our hero into even greater fires of adversity, forcing him to take a long look at himself and his beliefs before raising the more refined version of my favorite Greatcoat like a blazing phoenix. It is harsh, painful to read at times, but it is such a perfect ending to our heroâ€™s journey that I cannot now imagine Falcio and the Greatcoatsâ€™ story ending any other way.
Mixed into the exquisite flagellation, Sebastien de Castell still dazzles with his ability to deliver swashbuckling action, amazing camaraderie, funny moments, and classic heroics. His narrative finding the perfect balance between every emotion, tugging your heart strings one way and another; each twist in the plot spanning the spectrum from crushing despair to soaring excitement. Tyrantâ€™s Throne giving its frequent readers everything they could have ever hoped for in a finale, leaving one awed yet heartbroken that it had to finally come to an end.
Since my return to the fantasy genre about four years ago, Sebastien de Castell is among my favorites authors; his Greatcoats series listed among my most beloved fantasy series ever, resting proudly next to those of Tolkien, Donaldson, and many more. And while Tyrantâ€™s Throne is a fitting ending to this adventure, I dearly hope it will not be our last visit to the colorful world of Falcio and friends. This place having too many fascinating stories yet to tell. But until then, I will cherish my memories of my adventures riding and fighting alongside Falcio and the Greatcoats, proclaiming to all the villains of the world that â€œTHE GREATCOATS ARE COMING!â€
I received this book from the publisher in exchange for a fair and honest review. Iâ€™d like to thank them for allowing me to receive this review copy and inform everyone that the review you have read is my opinion alone. (less)",Positif
,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction, War, World War II, European Literature, British Literature",PorshaJo,"How could you not like a book that uses the word 'higgledy-piggledy' in it....multiple times. The Chilbury Ladies Choir is quite the fascinating read. A different take on WW2 and how people survive during this time. Don't get me wrong, any book on WW2 and the horrors is difficult to read. But this one, I found both sad and fascinating, heartbreaking and funny.
The story is told over a series of letters, newspaper articles, and journal entries and switches back and forth between these and various characters. You learn of the various people in the town of Chillbury. There is the wicked Edwina Paltry and the story of how low one person can sink. Or the saucy tart Victoria Winthrop, who changes, even grows-up during the war. Or bossy Mrs. B and her know-it-all attitude. Then there is the war, the bombings, the lives lost and during this time, the folks of Chillbury. Most of the men have gone off to war and it's up to the ladies in town to stand up and prove that they CAN do it. Such as to start an all female choir, enter a singing competition, become pall bearers, and show how brave they are.
I started this one ages ago and life got in the way. So I decided to switch to the audio recently. I loved the narration and the different voices and accents. And a bonus....choir music was included at the most perfect times. I did have a few nitpicks with this one though, hence the lower rating. I didn't care for the audio narration where it would indicate a male spoke. Sometimes the narrator, usually female, would do this odd voices for say, gruffy older men. And the precocious child Kitty,narrating into her journal, who at 13 used phrases that no 13 would know what they mean (the sirens were blistering, her talk of the black market). But those are minor items. Overall, an enjoyable read and one that I'm glad I finally finished. (less)",Positif
,"Thriller, Fiction, Mystery, Mystery Thriller, Psychological Thriller, Crime",Tom Lewis,"This book gets a big â€œholy crap!â€ The storyâ€™s told from the POV of Milly, the abused fifteen year old daughter of a serial killer mom. Momâ€™s arrested after Milly tips off the cops, and in the run up to momâ€™s trial, Millyâ€™s placed into foster care with Mike (Millyâ€™s shrink), Mikeâ€™s weirdo wife, and their nightmare daughter, Phoebe.
Milly wants to be loved, and find a home, but thereâ€™s a maze of obstacles in her way â€“ Phoebe gets the mean girls at school to bully her; she hears momâ€™s voice in her head, taunting her into accepting her destiny to become a serial killer herself; and Millyâ€™s nagging suspicions that maybe she did inherit momâ€™s tendencies.
Millyâ€™s an incredibly compelling character, and draws immediate sympathy; and yet every now and then, she lets a thought slip, and you know itâ€™s only a matter of time before she snaps. And most of the time, youâ€™re hoping she will. Great read! (less)",Positif
,"Fantasy, Mythology, Nonfiction, History, Audiobook",*Thea 'Wookiee'sMama' Wilson*,"This was such a fun read, a little tough on the brain with all the notes and appendixes (all nicely hyperlinked up so you never lose your place in the ebook edition, the physical version may end up being a little more difficult!) but you can tell a mile off that the wonderful Stephen Fry had a hand in this work. I read the whole book with his voice in my head, only Fry would use some of those big words in places where little ones would do just as well but that's him all over of course and the whole thing is nearly threaded through with his excellent sense of humour which only adds a lovely quirk to all the myths and legends inside. You can see the love he has for the myths he retells and it easily rubs off onto the reader like Neil Gaiman's Norse Mythology did.
If you're a fan of mythology and/or Stephen Fry then this is a MUST read and that goes for those that loved Gaiman's mythology book too as it's in the same kind of vein and I completely adore both books! (less)",Positif
,"Young Adult, Mystery, Contemporary, Fiction ",Yiling,"Quick read- if it was any longer it would have felt like it was dragging on because there was very little plot. VERY LITTLE. Most of the story was just setup and then in the last couple of pages there was a small reveal to resolve the story.

And TURNS OUT, it wasnâ€™t THAT bad
Hereâ€™s the deal, GO. IN. WITH. NEGATIVE. EXPECTATIONS.
Yes kids you heard me. Keep those expectations as low as they are with your math scores okay, trust me on this
Also know that the thriller aspect of the book is HEAVILY garnished with contemporary lit. like LOTS of it.
If youâ€™re looking for a thriller that will rattle your bones and make your stomach digest itself, this probably aint the book for you but if youre looking for a contemporary ft. an entertaining thriller, than this is your boi
I have to say, the ending part threw me off. Up till the resolution on why the murderer was murdering, I would have given a 4 star but the reasoning was just blehhhhhh
I enjoyed reading about the romance, it wasnâ€™t rushed and Stephanie perkins has this way of writing the cutest couples gahhhh but honestly I was CRAVING to see more of the other to-be-couples (view spoiler)
I also heard a lot of people say the thriller aspect was boooooring to them and bruh idk about you but THERE WERE PARTS THAT I WAS SHAKING so like just keep an open mind if youâ€™re gonna pick this one up
ALSO THIS IS PROBABLY THE FIRST CONTEMPORARY I READ THAT IS WRITTEN IN 3RD PERSON YYYAASSSS

,"Mystery, Fiction, Thriller, Mystery Thriller, Contemporary",Eryn,"I received a copy off of NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not persuade my true opinion of the novel.
2.25
So, this was quite ... strange. Very, very, strange - if I might say. At first, the story showed signs of promise, even if it seemed like all of the characters were border-line perverts (this is an exaggeration, but yes, there were just too many scenes focusing on sex - at least to me - plus, these characters are kids, so come on).
Gradually as the novel progressed, it slowly began getting worse and worse - up to the point where I didn't want to pick it up at all. That brief moment of a ""oh, interesting, it's a fresh perspective"" from the beginning, slowly drifted away as I tired of the shallow characters and plot.
Overall, I won't say more because I don't want to ruin anything for those who will read this. Regardless, I'm upset to give this such a low rating - however, because I did not enjoy myself and often found myself cringing as I was reading, I would say the rating is accurate.

,"Romance, M M Romance, Contemporary",Jay,"Note: Though I finished reading Painted on My Heart the day before it was released, I withheld publishing this negative review because I am a reviewer for a blog that participated in the blog tour for its release. Now that the tour is over, here is my review.
2 stars â€“ The writing team that is Kindle Alexander wrote the first M/M romance I ever read (Full Disclosure), and I have read a few others since then. So when the opportunity to read Painted on My Heart landed in my inbox, not only did I jump, I jumped eagerly. I hate to admit that I was thoroughly disappointed, but by the end of the book, I hated both of the main characters, so even though the plot was generally good, I simply donâ€™t have a positive response to make.
Artist Kellus Hardinâ€™s loyalty to his last boyfriend shattered him, and the man is still making a mess out of his life, but Kellus canâ€™t leave his best friend to waste away. Arik Layne is rich, powerful, and confident, and he has no interest in long-term relationshipsâ€¦until he meets Kellus. But even though Kellus is attracted, he canâ€™t put his heart on the line easily. Arik is determined to make Kellus his, no matter the cost.
Millionaire/billionaire stories are touch-and-go to me. Those that have millionaires who are leary of relationships because theyâ€™ve been taken advantage of are usually fine. But when the rich guy is the pushy, domineering type, the power imbalance caused by money is often too much for me to get enjoyment out of the story. Thatâ€™s pretty much the case in Painted on My Heart. I didnâ€™t care for Arikâ€™s attitude and demeanor from the outset, and once he and Kellus started dating, his solution to every one of Kellusâ€™s problems was to throw money at it, even when Kellus insisted he didnâ€™t want that. I just canâ€™t stomach a pushy son of a bitch who refuses to respect the wishes of the person he claims is the love of his life. Sure, when reading the rich-guy trope, I expect this sort of behavior to happen a couple of times in order to make it a point of contention between the couple, maybe even causing them to split for a while. Here, however, even up to the very last major problem in the book, Arik threw his financial might around against Kellusâ€™s wishes. But the final time, instead of Kellus being pissed, he turns all puppy-dog on us, so by that point, I hated both of them.
But my issues with the book arenâ€™t limited to the characters. There are several plot-related issues I could start talking about, but that would make this review (rant) way longer than it needs to beâ€”though it would be fitting, considering this book is about twice as long as it needed to be, a fact which only made my ultimate hatred of the characters even more disappointingâ€”so Iâ€™ll limit it to the big one. And unfortunately, I canâ€™t talk about it without spoilers, so Iâ€™m going to hide it with a spoiler tag: The ultimate resolution of the plot around Kellusâ€™s ex-boyfriend included the revelation that (view spoiler). As if that werenâ€™t bad enough, whereas this sort of revelation should have basically destroyed Kellus again, his reaction to the news is so ho-hum, so unrealistic, and so unbelievable that I couldnâ€™t believe I had spent so many hours reading such total crap. I hate it when authors are so unrelenting to their characters, but to have it basically be brushed off? ARGH!
As much as I credit the ladies who are Kindle Alexander for starting my love for M/M romance, Painted on My Heart was a total disappointment. I kept waiting for it to get better, for them to draw me into the world and lives of their characters the way they did in the other books I read. But no dice. Damn.
I wish I had known in advance, because I know how difficult writing is, so I truly hate trashing books. But for me, ""fair and honest"" means exactly that.
The author and/or publisher generously provided me a complimentary copy of Painted on My Heart in exchange for this fair and honest review.

,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Short Stories, Anthologies",Melanie,"Because You Love to Hate Me: 13 Tales of Villainy is a short story anthology that was curated and edited by the amazing, and so very talented, Ameriie. Seriously, Ameriie is an angel and I'm so thankful that she put this anthology together. I completely believe this collection will appeal to so many readers. I mean, these stories surround villains and their often misunderstood back stories, and then throw in some amazingly talented and popular authors, and then some of the most popular Booktubers around right now, and you truly have something different that many YA readers can appreciate and get excited over. It's honestly genius and a great way to celebrate reading and the literary community in general.
There is a lot of controversy about whether or not these Booktubers ""deserved"" to get published, and I'm not here to start a war over that, but I will say that these people put a lot of work into their videos and have been doing it long enough to get pretty substantial followings. This book is going to sell a lot of copies, and for that alone it makes sense that they ""deserve"" to be published. I mean, capitalism exists in the book world, too.
I know many Booktubers don't read as much as the average reviewer and I know many want to write their own books. I also know many people in the book community are upset the Booktubers don't read the ARCs they are sent and I know many people dislike their paid promotions. I see these things, I truly do. But guess what? These Booktubers are human beings, who read your hurtful words, and are just accepting opportunities that the publishers are giving them. If you don't like them, unsubscribe to them. If you don't like their writing or their books then write a review saying why you don't like their writing or their books.
Also, you all have free will. You don't have to pick this book up. I'm a firm believer in ""speaking with your money/wallet"" and no one is making you support these people. And let's be real, most the people who are complaining about this, will be complaining about people speaking up against harmful representation tomorrow. It's okay to bash on Booktubers who don't ""deserve"" to be published, but God forbid someone write a review on a book they've never read about how people from that culture are saying that the representation hurts their people.
Lastly, most Booktubers are aware of their privilege, and some of the people on this list use their platform for good discussions that I wish the book community would actually listen to. You guys know I always give my honest opinion, and you know I will with this review, too. I'm not going to judge the Booktubers I love and subscribe to differently than the Booktuber I'm not the biggest fan of. Also, I'll even give you guys full disclosure on the Booktubers I love in my break down of each story.
Overall, this was actually a pretty strong anthology and it held a lot of really good stories that I would completely recommend, especially if you are a fan of these authors. Maybe it impressed me because I had my expectations set so low, but I truly closed this book happy that I read it.
âž½My Favorite Story: Marigold by Samantha Shannon
âž½My Favorite Prompt: ZoÃ« Herdt's (readbyzoe)
âž½My Favorite Essay: The Bad Girls' Guide to Villainy by Steph Sinclair and Kat Kennedy at Cuddlebuggery
With every anthology that I review I break down and rate each story individually. I just want to preface this breakdown by saying that I will be critiquing these stories and prompts and these essays. I also gushed a little bit about a couple of my personal favorite Booktubers. I'm sorry if I didn't enjoy something that your favorite Booktuber prompted or that your favorite author wrote, but I hope you still respect my opinion(s) and understand that everyone has different tastes, especially with reading. I broke down and reviewed each story individually, while also giving each story its own star rating, and I gave my personal thoughts on every prompt.
Also, if you'd prefer to go into the anthology completely blind and unaware of any of the prompts, please do not continue reading any further. I won't be giving any spoilers or anything like that, but while reading this book, the prompts come after you've read the story! So, again, you should not read this break down if you want your reading experience to be a complete surprise!
âž½ The Blood of Imuriv by RenÃ©e Ahdieh - â˜…â˜…
â€¢ Prompt and The Evil Vaccine: Keep the Darkness at Bay by Christine Riccio at PolandbananasBOOKS
I was really disheartened that this was the start to this anthology, because I really didn't enjoy this story at all. I mean, if I could get a full length story about this world I would probably read it, but I just personally feel that it didn't make for that great of a short story. This story is about a boy, who is forced to sit by the sidelines and watch his sixteen year old sister get ready to one day rule. He obviously doesn't like that and wishes that he could change the future he is destined to only watch from the sidelines. I'll be honest, I really disliked the prompt and I even thought her essay thing was trying way too hard to be funny and it felt so forced and ended up being really unfunny. Also, making jokes and/or light hearted fun about vaccination just kind of feels bad anyways. RenÃ©e Ahdieh's beautiful writing did shine through, and for that I gave it two stars, but I honestly did not enjoy this story what so ever. The best part was that it takes place in a matriarchal society. Also, I honestly and truthfully hate the Beatles.
âž½ Jack by Ameriie - â˜…â˜…â˜…
â€¢ Prompt and Giants and Tyrants by Tina Burke at Lushables
This story was better than the first and I loved Amerrie's writing. Tina Burke's idea to use a real life historical figure villain with an old classic fairy tale villain was beyond wonderful and so creative! I also loved Tina's very thoughtful and informative part at the end. Her closing section was seriously one of the best in this entire book, and I loved reading it as much as I loved reading the story. This story is a never before seen take on Jack and the Beanstalk and it, too, does not disappoint. Amerrie wrote a completely captivating story that even made me laugh a few times.
âž½ Gwen and Art and Lance by Soman Chainani - â˜…â˜…â˜…
â€¢ Prompt and The Bad Girl Hall of Fame by Samantha Lane at Thoughts on Tomes
You guys need to understand that I tried really hard not to be biased here, but I love Sam! Like, she is such a bright shining light in this community, and I'm not sure what the book world has done to deserve her. Plus, she's such a strong woman, whose aesthetic is beyond words, who loves video games, isn't afraid to be critical of what's popular, calls out problematic things, and is such an amazing analyst of books in general. Plus, when I think of book reviewers that love villains, I think of Sam. I knew her prompt was going to be nothing short of amazing. And her final thoughts with social media posts and comments were nothing short of brilliant. Her prompts spoke to me and my likes on every level and I am so happy for her and proud of her.
Also, this story was amazing. Just know, if you like or are just familiar with Arthurian legends about King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table you are going to enjoy this. And everyone knew that this would have Hades and Persephone elements because of Sam. Yet, I also would recommend this short story if you are a fan of Illuminae, because Soman Chainani has created an amazing story just in multimedia format via IMs. I know I gushed a lot about Sam, but Soman's story unique and really enjoyable to read! Also, his villain was the perfect amount of grey that I'm always looking for.
âž½ Shirley & Jim by Susan Dennard - â˜…â˜…â˜…
â€¢ Prompt and Dear Sasha, the 411 for Villains by Sasha Alsberg at abookutopia
I also have a soft spot in my heart for Sasha. She just genuinely seems like such a little sweetheart to me, and she's one of the few Booktubers on this list that I genuinely am excited for and want to read her published work. Also, her prompt was short, simple, and perfect.
This story just feels bad. Like, if Susan Dennard would have just wrote a Sherlock and Watson gender-bent love story people would have lost it and completely loved this. Instead she gender bends Sherlock and Watson so they can gush about Moriarty? Like, she could have just, you know, left Sherlock and Watson boys, and had Sherlock gush over Moriarty and people would have loved that too. Instead, we get this bad feeling, pointless gender-bend modern day version of Sherlock Holmes. It is extra sad, because this short story was pretty addicting. Also, it's beautifully written, but it just feels so bad thinking of what could have been.
âž½ The Blessings of Little Wants by Sarah Enni - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…
â€¢ Prompt and Will the Real Villain Please Stand Up? by Sophia Lee at thebookbasement
This story was so good. The prompt and the story were close to perfection. This story is about two witches that are trying to save magic. Half way through, these two characters were sitting in their common room, surrounded by books, I thought I was reading a much darker version of some kind of side quest in Harry Potter. Seriously, this short story is amazing.
Also, I already said Sophia's prompt was perfection, but her essay at the end was what I wish everyone's essay was like. It was informative, while making me think, and even pulled at my heartstrings a little bit. And I, too, want to know all of the things Sophia wants to know upon finishing this short story. Like, I hope they pair up again and give me at least a novella about Sigrid and the consequences of her choices.
âž½ The Sea Witch by Marissa Meyer - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…
â€¢ Prompt and Villain or Hero? You Decide! by ZoÃ« Herdt at readbyzoe
The only complaint I have about this short story is that I wish it was a full length novel. Marissa Meyer is the queen of fairy-tale retellings for a reason, and ZoÃ« was so very smart to give her an inspiration that plays to her strength. This book is a take on the sea witch from The Little Mermaid and it was everything I could have asked for and more. This short story also talks about loneliness in the face of only wanting love, and then betrayal when you only wanted to be accepted. Perfect villain, perfect messages, perfect story. Like, if you're a fan of Marissa Meyer, this short story is a must read.
Also, ZoÃ« is so sweet. How can anyone not love her? And her essay was so amazing as well. She really talked about a side of her life that I think so many people can relate to, even though I believe she is nothing close to a coward. I also loved her quiz, even though I ended up being a villain!
âž½ Beautiful Venom by Cindy Pon - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…
â€¢ Prompt and Without the Evil in the World, How Do We See the Good? by Benjamin Alderson at Benjaminoftomes
TW: Rape (very minor and nothing graphic, but it is there.)
This story was also perfection. I love the discussion on beauty standards and expectations, while even touching on the expectations of young girls to remain virginal. Also, this story probably has the most evil villain in this entire anthology, and the twist was so beautiful and nothing you'd expect in a Medusa remake. Also, now I want to read everything Cindy Pon has written.
I also am a pretty big fan of Ben, and his prompt was exactly what I wanted and expected from this anthology. Ben broke down different elements of the story and talked about some of his favorite parts. I wish all the Booktubers did this, instead of their ""creative"" things, because this flowed so well and just highlighted Cindy Pon's story, while adding a great perspective.
âž½ Death Knell by Victoria Schwab - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…
â€¢ Prompt and Dear Death by Jesse George at JessetheReader
I had a pretty good feeling that VE Schwab would write one of the best stories in this anthology, no matter what her prompt was, and she didn't disappoint. Her story made me so unexpectedly emotional, too. Like, I had tears on my cheeks through the entirety of this short story. I actually think this could be my favorite thing that VE Schwab has ever written. Seriously, if you're a fan of her beautiful and mesmerizing writing, read this short story.
Jesse's essay ended up hitting really close to home for me, too. It was really impactful and showed a vulnerable side of him that I really appreciated, especially surrounding the topic of death. I loved both parts of this collaboration.
âž½ Marigold by Samantha Shannon - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…
â€¢ Prompt and Evil Revealed by Regan Perusse at PeruseProject
Okay, I know I've handed out a ton of five stars in a row, but this short story felt like it was written for me. Her prompt had to do with a folklore story about a fae queen that kidnaps young girls in nineteenth-century London. If you follow my reviews, you know that this screams ""Melanie""! I couldn't not give this five stars, and Samantha Shannon weaves an amazing tale that balances whimsy and female empowerment. Like, I want an entire series surrounding this short story immediately.
I love Regan (and Matilda) and she, like Ben, broke down Samantha's story with her thoughts and feelings, which made for such a wonderful transition that felt so right and cohesive. Also, I think she might be one of the few Booktubers that is not planning on writing a book, which is a damn shame, because her writing is absolutely fantastic. This was, hands down, the best written thing from any of the Booktubers, and I even enjoyed it more than some of the actual stories written by published authors in this anthology. Regan is so talented, and it shined so brightly through with her essay. Oh, and her prompt was the second best of the entire collection, too. Regan gets all the stars!
âž½ You, You, It's All About You by Adam Silvera - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…
â€¢ Prompt and Behind the Villain's Mask by Catriona Feeney at LittleBookOwl
I really enjoyed this story, and it felt so much different than the rest of the anthology, in a good way. Also, teenage girl crime lord that wears a mask made from the old skin of her abusive father? Like, please, allow me to buy this full length novel. Also, the different drugs that Adam's main character dealt were so interesting. They were all so inventive and I honestly wish I knew even more. This was a really strong story and I think many people would really enjoy this one.
I didn't really care for Catriona's essay on different masks. It wasn't terrible or anything, but it, again like many of the others, made my reading experience feel disjointed after I read Adam's beautiful story.
âž½ Julian Breaks Every Rule by Andrew Smith - â˜…â˜…â˜…
â€¢ Prompt and Julian Powell: Teen Psycho Extraordinaire by Raeleen Lemay at padfootandprongs07
I enjoyed this story well enough, and it definitely made you want to keep turning the pages to see why Julian cannot for the life of himself get in trouble for his mysterious powers of willing people to die. I almost thought the prompt was going to have to do with Death Note, but it was just a generic prompt about psychopaths in the future. I did like how this story bordered on not knowing if Julian really had these powers, or if he just thought he did. Being in an unreliable narrators mind is always a fun thing to read about, and I feel like Andrew Smith did a really good job executing that.
I'm not sure if she creates Booktube videos anymore, which, I'm not going to lie, feels pretty bad, because I know there are so many active Booktubers out there that would have loved to be a part of something like this. Obviously I didn't hold that against her prompt, but I also won't lie that I felt a little disheartened when I looked up her channel and saw she hasn't posted a ""Booktube"" video in five months and that she's only posted three videos in all of 2017.
âž½ Indigo and Shade by April Genevieve Tucholke - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…
â€¢ Prompt and Glamorized Recovery: Expectations vs. Reality by Whitney Atkinson at WhittyNovels
Whitney's prompt had to do with Beauty and the Beast and it was magnificent. I've never read anything by April Genevieve Tucholke before, but her writing was fantastic and so engrossing. I was instantly pulled into this retelling that somehow merged Bell, the Beast, and Gaston all into one. Like, I can't explain it without spoilers, but it was very well done. I love the whimsical in this, I loved the feministic undertones, and I loved the ending.
âž½ Sera by Nicola Yoon - â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…
â€¢ Prompt and The Bad Girls' Guide to Villainy by Steph Sinclair and Kat Kennedy at Cuddlebuggery
This story is a look into a child's life, and why she is ""evil"". The look at each time period was a little boring at first, but when I got to the present day part? Oh, boy, it was amazing and such a powerful story to end this anthology on. I really enjoyed it, and I want to know everything about Sera and where life is going to take her now. Also, the prompt was ""Gender-Flipped God of War"" and when I read those words I actually got Goosebumps. Plus, Steph and Kat's essay was also perfectly executed with feminism and just the glory of being a strong woman. It was also funny while also talking about some powerful and real situations in today's world. I loved it. Easily the best prompt in this entire collection. Praise and bless all three powerful women that collaborated on this story! Wonderful story and a wonderful prompt.
I gave this 4 stars overall, because out of a possible 65 stars (5 stars possible for each of the 13 stories) this collection accumulated 50 stars (83%).

This was a five star Traveling Sister Read! Thatâ€™s why I bumped my rating up to the full five stars! I figured a book that had inspired such an amazing discussion was more than worthy of a five star rating! So thank you ladies for making this book even more special for me!
Not going to lie at the beginning of this book I was slightly disappointed, I was waiting for all this spellcasting and broomstick riding, but that didnâ€™t happen.... but as I continued reading I got it the MAGIC was in these amazing characters and the message of the book... this isnâ€™t to say that they didnâ€™t have any supernatural powers, they just were subtle, just a touch of magic!
The siblings Frannie, Jet, and Vincent had such an incredible bond.... they were really there for one another through the good times and the heartbreak..... they also all had a very special bond with their pets/familiars.... really this book had the theme of love running through out.... because really what is life without love? Not necessarily romantic love, but the love between siblings, friends, parent and child... The book also was about forgiveness, sometimes it is the hardest thing to do, but I think it is the greatest healer of oneâ€™s heart....
If you are hesitant to pick this up because of the magical realism, Iâ€™d say definitely give this a try! Because really the real MAGIC is in these amazing well develop characters and the story of their remarkable life....
donâ€™t just love, love moreðŸ’•

,"Thriller, Mystery, Fiction, Mystery Thriller, Crime, Suspense",Maxine (Booklover Catlady),"Absolutely freaking brilliant! I didn't want this book to end but what a fantastic finish! This is going to be THE crime thriller of 2017. This is already in my list of Top 17 Books of 2017, skipping the long list and the short list.
I'm a huge fan of J.D. Barker, he's an exceptionally talented writer and this book has been given some great kudos from top authors and reviewers for a good reason - it's really bloody good! Unputdownable good. There is quite simply nothing not to like. I
It's just freaking awesome!
I've read his novel Forsaken, his short stories and eagerly await the prequel to Dracula he's been asked to pen alongside Dacre Stoker, yes relative of THE Bram Stoker. When I got my hands on this ARC my squeal could be heard in towns all around.
We have a serial killer at work. A very clever, very evil serial killer who has evaded the police for a very long time...they need to catch this psychopath and quickly. The book pulls no punches as from opening pages you are going to be hooked by the dynamic plot that will have you trying to figure out the ending from page one.The book might beat you - I warn you now. Twists and reveals to die for! Don't get too complacent you've got it all worked out.
Just WHO is the 4MK Killer?
Barker does characters exceptionally well and that shines all the way through The Fourth Monkey, there is real depth and I got really involved with every single on whilst reading the book. Despite it being a book that seems like a long read I just lost all sense of real time and devoured the lot!
I couldn't put this book down. I read it over a few hours and loved every single word. The characters are brilliant (oh hang on, I said that already) and the victims...oh, the victims. I was right there with them. This crime thriller is not afraid to push the boundaries. With comparisons to Se7en and Silence of the Lambs I wondered if it could really live up to such praise. Oh yes! Oh yes indeed!
This is dark, scary and twisty.
There are some incredibly good graphic scenes, yet Barker does not push it so far that it becomes unreadable, if you know what I mean? It's ""just right"" in the balance. As a crime thriller it does have that tinge and atmosphere of Barker's brilliant horror writing edge. I knew from reading Forsaken and early short stories by this author that he was going to be hitting the big-time and here we are! Second novel and a world-wide release, not bad at all Mr Barker - huge respect.
It doesn't matter what genre of book you love. This book has mass reader appeal and I am predicting it to be a best selleron publication date in June. One of those much talked about books that will make your reading year so much better. Update: Today is publication date and this book has had the most outstanding reviews, buzz and is selling up a storm as predicted!
I'm not revealing any plot. The plot itself is brilliant. It threw me around and left me with bruises.I had moments where I yelled for characters, held my breath and re-read paragraphs to let the enormity of it all sink-in. This is book entertainment people. Fantastic!
I'm gushing right? Well, I just really think it's a book that deserves my high praise. I love a good serial killer book and J.D. Barker delivered me the goodies in every way. I have raved about this book to literally every single person that breathes. I am DESPERATE for a sequel!
This is one serial killer you really DO need to meet this year. 5 huge stars. Superb!

She wouldnâ€™t be who she was now without her struggles. Life had shaped her, her fear had formed her, and I wouldnâ€™t have her any differently.
The WINSTON BROTHERS series is fast becoming one of my favorites by Penny Reid. I never thought a bunch of oddball quirky characters would win my heart so easily, but all I can say is that I canâ€™t get enough of these crazy and lovable bunch of characters. I love them so much that I would become an honorary Winston if it were even possible! These siblings are always there for each other and ready to lend a helping hand whenever necessary, and when they find that special someone, they become completely wrecked by love in the most amazing ways! I think Penny needs to create a new Winston brother just for me. BEARD IN MIND coincides with the same timeline as BEARD SCIENCE and although these books can be read as standalones, I highly recommend reading the previous books, if only so you get to experience the awesomeness of this series!!
Beau is considered to be the charismatic Winston twin and the most well-liked by all out of the entire group of siblings. He goes out of his way to say a kind word and to help his fellow townâ€™s people out of a jam whenever necessary. Women fall all over themselves to get his attention and he could be the biggest player if he wanted but Beau is looking to find a special lady to settle down with. Seeing some of his brothers in blissful relationships has his heart yearning for the same type of connection for himself. Beau has never had problems charming the opposite sex but when Cleetus hires a stunningly beautiful mechanic with an abrasive attitude, he just may have met his match.
Shelly Sullivan is Quinnâ€™s younger sister. For those of you who have read the Knitting in the City series, you will be quite familiar with Quinn â€˜akaâ€™ McHotPants. Shelly has left her home in Chicago and moved to Tennessee in hopes of getting the help she needs to manage her OCD. For the past couple of years, she has closed herself off from her family because her OCD became almost too much for her to handle and she didnâ€™t want to subject her loved ones to her bizarre behavior. She is not able to initiate physical contact with anyone because she then gets plagued by an overwhelming fear that the person will be in danger. She would then resort to cutting herself to help relieve the anxiety. Since moving to Tennessee, sheâ€™s been seeing a therapist and has refrained from cutting for almost a year. When she and Beau first meet, her blunt dialogue and seemingly rude demeanor rubs him the wrong way and Beau is convinced that Cleetus needs to fire her. While he finds her attitude to be annoying his attraction to Shelly is overwhelming him and little does he know she is just as, if not more into him.
When Shelly tries to fight through her fears and anxiety to make a move on Beau, itâ€™s awkward but hilarious as well. Beau then realizes that he may have been a little too quick in judging Shelly and he decides to give in to the crazy attraction that is between them. Beau with his huge heart is not scared off when he learns to the full extent how much Shellyâ€™s OCD impacts her life and her ability to interact with others. He even goes to some of her sessions with her Psychologist and agrees to participate in some new aggressive form of therapy to help Shelly with her inability to initiate physical contact. Sharing something so personal and being intimate with each other as well, has feelings growing with intensity, but while Beau is more forthcoming, Shelly is closed off and reserved. This dredges up Beauâ€™s deeply embedded insecurities which have him believing heâ€™s not good enough to be loved.
Aside from the angsty and steamy bits between Beau and Shelly, there is a huge revelation that impacts the Winstonâ€™s and I felt that towards the end of the book it overshadowed the romance between the Hero and Heroine. The ending seemed to wrap up too quickly. Even though this is quite a lengthy novel, I still felt like Shellyâ€™s OCD was a huge issue that the couple needed to find a way to cope with and I would have really enjoyed it if we could have gotten closure with her family.
BEARD IN MIND releases on August 1st! Penny Reid fans are sure to enjoy it. For those of you who havenâ€™t read anything by Penny, this is a series worth checking out.

Drew Jagger is a 29 yr. old successful attorney in New York. He lives and works in a building on Park Avenue that's considered prime real estate in NYC. He returns home from a vacation to find a beautiful feisty woman in his office. While he was out of town his office space was to be renovated. He comes back to this woman accusing him of being an intruder.
Emerie Rose freaks out when she thinks a man is breaking into her new office she just rented about a week ago. She proceeds to attack her intruder only to learn he actually is the true owner of her office. Turns out she was scammed out of her life savings & rented an office that wasn't available.
Suddenly she has little funds & nowhere to go. Drew offers to let Emerie help him out while his secretary is on leave in exchange for rent. They are like night & day and complete opposites. As a psychologist, Emerie was in the business of repairing relationships, while Drew helped to destroy them as a divorce attorney. They clash daily & seem to do nothing but argue which continues to fuel their intense sexual tension. They are extremely attracted to one another, & eventually sharing space together creates a connection. They begin spending more time together & it's easy and fun between them. Drew shamelessly flirts with Emerie & makes advances. She can't help the way her body reacts to him, and eventually they act on their mutual desire & indulge in one another physically.
-He really is beautiful. I wasn't sure I'd ever thought of a man as beautiful before. Handsome, yes. Hot, even. But beautiful fit the bill to describe Drew Jagger-no other word did him justice.
-Never in my life had I felt so much desire.
-Drew Jagger had stirred a lot of things inside of me that I hadn't felt in a long time.
Drew was burned bad by a woman in his past & as a result he's cynical about love & commitment. He only enjoys sexual relationships with women and doesn't get attached or do feelings, so when he starts having real feelings for Emerie it scares him to death. He has trouble with trust, but finds himself wanting more with Emerie.
Emerie knows Drew's reputation, and doesn't want to get too attached & then get hurt, but when she grows closer to him & gets to know him better she can't help herself. He has such a beautiful heart and she fall's hard for him.
I really enjoyed this book & love Vi's writing! She knows how to create the perfect, arrogant, sexy, breathtakingly gorgeous, irresistible man that I can't help fall for every time!

,"Thriller, Fiction, Mystery, Mystery Thriller, Psychological Thriller, Crime",j e w e l s [Books Bejeweled],"The very first sentence of the blurb reads: ""Milly's mother is a serial killer."" WHAAAT? That's not a phrase you read every day! I knew right then I wanted to read this debut novel by Ali Land. This book does not disappoint! Start reading on a Saturday afternoon and you might as well cancel any plans you had for going out, 'cause you ain't going' nowhere!
A psychological study, this book is more of a brain-teaser than a chilling cliff-hanger type story. And I'm okay with that. I love to climb inside a head and poke around. I'd much rather read a disturbed person's musings than read about any horrific killing scene they may have engaged in.
The story is told solely through Milly's eyes and consists mostly of internal thoughts over dialogue or action. Still, it reads at a fast clip, and the first-person narrative is so very effective here. You are never sure if Milly is a reliable narrator, especially because she straight up admits she struggles with being good and bad. And like most humans, she presents her good side to the world, so is she showing the reader only her good side?? Just when you think you've got Milly figured out, NOOOOO. You're wrong! I love it!!!!
As far as the ick factor of a female child molester/killer, there are a few disturbing flashback moments, but I stress MOMENTS, not full on chapters. The foundation of this story is built on Milly starting her shiny new life at the age of 15, having just turned in her mother for the atrocious crimes.
I was really on track to give GOOD ME BAD ME a five star rating on Goodreads. But, somewhere about 1/2 way through, it starts to feel a tiny bit draggy. Still worthy of 4.25 stars in my humble opinion!
I think the problem lies in the plot structure. There isn't a classic murder puzzle to solve and some of the situations felt implausible. For instance, I could never figure out how Milly's mom was able to continue killing without getting caught. For heaven's sake, the bodies are all in the basement (not a spoiler). Wasn't anyone investigating these missing children?
I'm also wary of what I call the ""coincidence factor"". Too many coincidences in the plot for my liking. For example, Milly's foster father is also her psychiatrist. He has a daughter the same age as Milly. The daughter just happens to be a mean girl, etc.
There is a major plot twist at the end of the book that you may see coming. Milly also frequently ""talks"" to her estranged mother and sometimes it was confusing to me as a reader. All minor issues, I still highly recommend the book.
Ali Land is a talented, skillful writer with a background in child mental health. She obviously knows of what she writes! She is a master creator of characters. Absolutely flawless in that department.
I usually prefer character driven novels over plot driven ones. OBSESSION, by Amanda Robson, is one of my favorite new character driven novels. But, after reading GOOD ME BAD ME, I realize I do like a bit more plot and action in a novel.
Ali Land's sentences are concise, no commas needed. (LIFE GOALZ). The pace of the writing is on point and completely effortless. A joy to read. I'm really looking forward to this young writer's future career! This will be a Fall must-read when it publishes on September 5, 2017.

In light of current events, I wanted to know more than just what I was seeing or hearing in sound bites, click bait, or Facebook memes. Reading this book was a profound gift. It gave me a basic understanding of key beliefs. It gave me historical and cultural context for current world events. It gave me some perspective on the conflict today between radical Islam and the vast majority of Muslims. We focus so often on our differences, but the value placed on faith and family in these essays and the role of this in daily Muslim life was very similar to what I see in conservative Christian families in my hometown. These letters from Ghobash to his son are intimate and heartfelt. The writing is exquisite and profound. I'm not sure if I have ever highlighted or noted as many passages as I did in this book. Regardless of your personal faith, these letters speak to the what it means to grow up, to forge an identity separate from your parents, to question and to embrace the values that define you, and to appreciate the way your community can challenge and shape you. Ghobash writes about responsibility, freedom, identity, education, what it means to be an outsider and more. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. (less)",Positif
,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Retellings, Fairy Tales",Misty,"I really wanted to love this book but I just couldn't. It was enjoyable at times though. The book starts off when the Beast shows Belle the library. Love and Death have been watching the Beast and 
Belle and made a wager with each other. Death, of course, tries to cheat and almost succeeds. Nevermore, the enchanted book is appealing to Belle so much so that she is willing to stay within its pages forever. When Belle finally realizes the truth about the book, it seems like she might get lost in it forever. I didn't like how the author portrays Belle in this book. Belle seemed quite naive and weak and even unlikable at times. That's not how I see Belle and I just thought that her character was flawed. (less)",Negatif
,"Mystery, Crime, Thriller, Fiction",Phrynne,"Number four in the Erika Foster series and every bit as unputdownable as the first three. The book starts with a murder, then we are introduced to the murderer and then we are put in the position of knowing everything and praying for the cops to catch up. By the end it is edge of the seat, chewing your finger nails and hyperventilating as Erika and her team get nearer and nearer but will they get there in time?
This is proving to be a very rewarding series. The stories are good, the characters are appealing and there is always lots of action. Robert Bryndza writes well and knows how to rack up the tension and maintain the reader's interest. Altogether excellent and I hope there will be more to come.

,"Science Fiction, Mystery, Fiction, Dystopia, Apocalyptic",Michelle Morrell,"What kind of post-apocalypse novel is this, where smart and good people do smart and good things, and lead a decent life because of it? A hugely refreshing addition to the genre, that's what!
Set a few generations past the collapse of society, we follow the story of Enid, an ""Investigator"" who is called to the site of a death, which may or may not have been murder. And while this frames the story, it's more a tale of learning from the mistakes of the past and fixing what went wrong. Towns now consist of households, a family unit made of many permutations of adults, all working towards the strength of the community, hoping to prove they can provide for themselves and contribute to the good of the neighborhood, eventually earning a banner that gives them permission to bring a child into the world, one for whom will be properly supported and cared.
I loved the tone of this book. Optimism and hope and wisdom abound. Even with the deaths and lies and glimpses of the darker side of human nature, this left me feeling uplifted, without the dark aftertaste of dispair that most post-apocalyptic tales wallow in.

The Duke of Asbury is looking for a bride to produce an heir and sets up a marriage of convenience with a seamstress named Emma. He has some rules that she must follow, the only problem is that she intends to break them all!
I loved the the character of the Duke, he is great, a stout man with very dry humor and sharp wit. He was scarred in war and the novel feels like a Beauty and the Beast retelling.
The scenes I loved the most were the ones where Duke was in. Some parts of the novel are very different from the standard romance story and it feels fresh and original. I wish there would have been a bit more sexual tension or build up because I lost a little bit of interest in the plot.

,"Nonfiction, religion, Islam, Autobiography, Memoir, Philosophy ",Hina Zephyr,"As a practicing Muslim I have been plagued with many questions which Omar Gobash boldly asks in this book. Questions which are urgent and relevant in toady's charged political climate. Questions which we need to ask ourselves (how much responsibility does each one of us carry as a Muslim), ask our political leaders(when will they stop dividing, conquering and plundering), ask our clerics (who are living in a time capsule of the former glory days of Islam), ask the so-called, self appointed flag bearers (why they are exempt from the rules of moral and humane behavior) and challenge our societal order (why women are given lesser place in most patriarchal countries).He holds the mirror up and the reflection is not pretty. Islamic history has been fraught with intrigue and battles for power and glory as with any other civilization. But in the past few decades, it has taken a very ugly turn and unless each one of us acknowledges that there is something very wrong with the fire that is burning around us, it will continue to consume us.
Omar Gobash is not making excuses for what's wrong with Islam today. He's asking us to stop accepting the order of things, to reflect, to study, to pause, to think and to engage with others. Because at the end of the day we do have a shared humanity and we owe it to Islam to ""educate ourselves, work hard, and find the answers to life's difficult questions..""
It is time to look beyond the binary world of black and white Islam of the clerics, and to welcome the diverse opinions which are made up of all shades of gray.
I recommend this book for it's honesty and it's thought provoking approach. For a long time we have been told to accept the order of things, not to ask any questions as it is tantamount to blasphemy, but Islam encourages questions and differences of opinion. Islam places a high value on a moral code and on taking responsibility. It is time to walk the talk! (less)",Positif
,"Mystery, Fiction, Writing, Books About Books, Thriller, Mystery Thriller",Amalia Gavea,"This book came highly recommended by dear Goodreads friends and the front cover was more than inviting. So, the time finally came for me to start reading during a week-long seaside vacation. It seemed to be the perfect spot for reading a literary thriller. Almost two weeks later, I'm writing this review. It took me so long to gather my thoughts, because I'm in the unpleasant position to say that this was a book I liked. Just that. And if I take all of my expectations into consideration, then simply ""liking"" it isn't enough. I wanted to be blown away, to emerge myself to an experience that would feel similar to The Thirteenth Tale which I consider the finest bookish mystery. Instead, I found a book that was good. Sometimes, ""good' makes me feel so disappointed....
The story starts with a bang, when something terrible happens inside a bookstore. From then on, Lydia -the main character- tries to find the answers to Joey's quest and to break free from a nightmare that butchered her childhood and her relationship with her father. One could say that we have quite a lot to focus on as readers. A suicide, a family massacre, a young man's struggle to break free from his tyrannical family, a troubled man estranged from his only child. Perhaps, it was a bit too much for the writer to handle.
For the most part, the writing was enganging. At times, it was almost poetic. Denver is so beautifully described that I felt I was there as I was reading. I think the writer succeeded in creating the atmosphere of the wintry city during the night with its bright lights and the dark corners. The bookstore also came to life so the setting was tangible and familiar. The dark scenes were also vividly depicted and I confess that I did look over my shoulder and out of the window once or twice. So what went wrong?
In my opinion, there was something in the interactions that left me utterly cold. I understand that it's a thriller, a situation we cannot fully relate to, so I wasn't particularly bothered by that. However, the dialogue was full of issues, in my opinion. I found it wooden, uninspired and, at times, unrealistic. Often, I found it awkward, silly, like a B- police film. It didn't take over the whole book but it was problematic for me. A book needs to succeed in all levels to feel satisfying and the interactions here were far from ideal.
My major problem is much better described in Adina's brilliant review. I felt that the ""bookish"" theme wasn't as present as I'd wanted it to be. Yes, there is a bookstore, a number of books become the instruments of discovery and Lydia is a major bookworm, but other than these instances, there was nothing substantial. I expected references to books, authors and literary characters, something that would trigger Lydia's thinking. A few quotes, at the very least, but there was no sign of any of these. Therefore, I'd venture to say that the whole setting was more of a gimmicky to appeal to dedicated readers like us. It may sound harsh, but this is how I felt.
The solution of the crime itself was well-written. To a degree. I was convinced I'd discovered the culprit early on but the revelation came out of nowhere and the built-up was really good. It was clever to combine problematic relationships with family problems and a deep feeling of isolation for most of the characters in a way that wasn't melodramatic or mundane. However- I hate this word- the motive felt underwelming. Less than original. The Epilogue was cheesy, all this paranorms- buffoonery was completely unnecessary, the closure and the aftermath felt rushed and too convenient. Also, Lydia's behaviour in the end made no sense to me. It was the horrible Epilogue that made me consider this book a lost chance and a major disappointment.
Now these writing issues cannot but influence the characters of the story. I fully agree with James. Lydia was a very sympathetic heroine, strong and clever and sensitive at times, but she didn't make a lasting impression on me and the way she deals with her personal relationships was quite questionable. I can't say that the cast was anything special overall. Raj was indifferent and Thomas was someone that troubled me at first, but in the end fell flat on the floor of the narrative. Joey was the heart of the story and the only character that created feelings in me. Anger, sadness and a deep sense of actions that are always in vain. He is the most complex person in the book, the one who is remotely interesting.
I don't know...I suppose I may sound a bit all over the place, but I feel frustrated. Yes, the novel is interesting and I do recommend reading it. There were certain moments of darkness and bright ideas beautifully orchestrated, but upon turning the last page, I felt underwhelmed. Perhaps my expectations were once again too high. I feel that the author wanted to tackle many issues and tropes, but somewhere along the way, the momentum was lost. It seemed to me like a poorly organized attack in basketball. When the rhythm is good and then, a mediocre, inexperienced player decides to throw the ball to the stands. While I am glad I read it, I didn't find it exceptional or memorable. It was nothing I haven't seen before, and to be honest, there are other mysteries out there that are truly and honestly ""bookish"" without trying to pretend and trick us. So, three stars given with a heavy heart.... (less)",Positif

,"Cultural, Japan, Fiction, Asian Literature, Contemporary, Magical Realism, Novels, Mystery",Liesa,"Ich habe mich fast nicht getraut, mit diesem Buch zu beginnen. Es ist bei Lieblingsautoren ja doch oft so: Man schÃ¤tzt sie und weiÃŸ, dass sie eigentlich nur Sensationelles aufs Papier bringen und man ist jedesmal bei einem neuen Werk etwas ehrfÃ¼rchtig und hat dann aber doch irgendwie Angst, dass man zu hohe Erwartungen hat, mÃ¶glicherweise enttÃ¤uscht wird oder der Lieblingsautor nicht mehr an das anknÃ¼pfen kann, was er vielleicht frÃ¼her verÃ¶ffentlicht hat. So ist es mit â€žDie Ermordung des Commendatoreâ€œ zum GlÃ¼ck nicht, ich muss aber dennoch gestehen, dass meine Begeisterung sich nach den ersten paar Seiten doch etwas in Grenzen hieltâ€¦
Das Buch beginnt sehr ruhig und unspektakulÃ¤r und bleibt es fÃ¼r die ersten 100 Seiten auch. Der namenlose Protagonist ist Maler (er malt in erster Linie PortrÃ¤ts) und ein typischer Murakami-Protagonist: ruhig, pragmatisch, ehrlich und doch sehr einfach gestrickt. Er wird Ã¼berraschenderweise nach sechs Jahren Ehe von seiner Frau verlassen, setzt sich daraufhin ins Auto und startet eine Rundreise durch Japan. SchlieÃŸlich landet er in dem Haus, in dem der berÃ¼hmte Maler und inzwischen demente Vater einer seiner Studienkollegen lebte, bevor er krank wurde und darf fÃ¼rs erste dort wohnen bleiben. Das Haus liegt abgeschieden und ruhig auf einer Seite eines Berges. WÃ¤hrend seiner Zeit dort entdeckt er nicht nur ein seltsames GemÃ¤lde auf dem verborgenen Dachboden, sondern freundet sich auÃŸerdem auch mit Menshiki an, der auf der anderen Seite des Berges in einer prachtvollen Villa lebt und den von Anfang an eine seltsame und mysteriÃ¶se Aura umgibt. Unser Protagonist soll ein PortrÃ¤t fÃ¼r ihn anfertigen â€“ doch damit beginnen eine Reihe sonderbarer Dingeâ€¦
Murakami ist und bleibt Meister des ErzÃ¤hlens. In meinen Augen schafft es niemand, so nÃ¼chtern und dennoch im genau richtigen Tonfall banale und surreale Dinge zu schildern und verschiedene Welten miteinander zu vermischen, als wÃ¤re Ã¼berhaupt nichts besonderes dabei. Dennoch hatte ich an manchen Stellen das GefÃ¼hl, die Geschichte wÃ¼rde zu schleppend vorankommen. FÃ¼r mich war der Protagonist alles andere als die tragende ErzÃ¤hlkraft, vielmehr brachte erst Menshiki die Handlung zum Laufen und erst nach seinem ersten Auftreten hatte ich das GefÃ¼hl, dass es richtig losgeht. Spannend war es dennoch, den Gedanken unseres Protagonisten zu lauschen. Ich bin absolut keine Kunstkennerin, dennoch faszinierte es mich, wie er versuchte, den kÃ¼nstlerischen und persÃ¶nlichen Wurzeln des KÃ¼nstlers, der vor ihm in dem Haus lebte, zu ergrÃ¼nden und zu erklÃ¤ren â€“ auch wenn ich bis zum Schluss nicht wusste, wohin genau das fÃ¼hren soll, aber das wird dann sicherlich der zweite Band offenbaren â€“ das hoffe ich jedenfalls.
Generell setze ich grÃ¶ÃŸere Hoffnungen in den zweiten Band. Nicht, dass mir der erste jetzt nicht schon sehr gefallen hÃ¤tte; die Themen, mit denen Murakami hier spielt und wie er unsere Welt wieder einmal kunstvoll mit Wunderlichkeiten aus einer Parallelwelt verwebt ist einfach grandios, aber dennoch blieb die groÃŸe Spannung aus â€“ auch wenn es durchaus einige Wendungen gab, die ich nicht erwartet habe und die mich neugierig auf mehr gemacht haben. Ein Kapitel lang saÃŸ ich wie auf glÃ¼henden Kohlen, weil ich so nervÃ¶s war, wie Murakami das wohl auflÃ¶sen will. Ich habe dennoch das GefÃ¼hl, dass wir erst im zweiten Band die groÃŸen Wahrheiten und Ãœberraschungen erfahren und die Dinge so richtigrichtig in Gang kommen â€“ das heiÃŸt aber auch, dass wir uns noch etwas in Geduld Ã¼ben mÃ¼ssenâ€¦
Ich bin mir sicher, wer Murakami mag, wird auch diesen mÃ¶gen. FÃ¼r mich las es sich bisher ein wenig so, wie eine Mischung aus â€žMister Aufziehvogelâ€œ und â€ž1Q84â€œ â€“ beide gehÃ¶ren zu meinen Lieblingswerken von Murakami und ich hab das gute GefÃ¼hl, dass zusammen mit Band II auch â€žDie Ermordung des Commendatoreâ€œ ganz weit oben in meiner Rangliste landen wird. Murakami vermag es einfach, mich stundenlang an die Seiten seiner Romane zu fesseln, mich mit interessanten Ideen und Gedanken zu Ã¼berraschen, mit Kunst und Musik zu inspirieren und mich noch Stunden und Tage spÃ¤ter Ã¼ber das Gelesene nachdenken zu lassen. Auch wenn sich viele seiner Romane sehr Ã¤hnlich sind (was ich Ã¼brigens absolut nicht als Kritikpunkt werte), offenbart er doch in jedem Werk eine etwas andere Perspektive, lockt mit anderen Geschichten, Umgebungen und EinfÃ¤llen. Ihr kÃ¶nnt euch gar nicht vorstellen, wie neugierig ich jetzt schon auf den zweiten Band bin, der Ã¼brigens am 16.04.2018 erscheinen wird. Wie soll ich die Wartezeit bis dahin nur Ã¼berbrÃ¼cken?

,"Romance, Contemporary Romance, Contemporary, Humor, Funny, Did Not Finish",Tijuana *Book Twins Reviews*,"Jana Aston has done the unthinkable! She wrote a hero whoâ€™s swoonier than Sawyer Camden and hotter than Dr. Luke Miller! Jennings is everything I ever wanted! Heâ€™s sweet, sexy, and a dirty-talking sex god!
Romantic Comedy fans will absolutely love this book! If youâ€™re looking for a fun and flirty book that will make you squirm and laugh out loud in the same sentence--look not further. This is it! Buy it now!
Hereâ€™s the breakdown:26 year-old Violet has hit a rough patch and finds herself in an unexpected situation. Sheâ€™s leading a travel tour of Americaâ€™s top tourist sites. While contemplating her predicament, she decides to throw caution to the wind and live it up a little. That's exactly what she does when she meets a sexy stranger in the hotel bar.
Hereâ€™s what I loved:
Violet and Jennings heat things up pretty quickly. Shortly after meeting him, she decides he's the one. She wants to have a sexy one night stand and he's more handsome than she ever dreamed. There's no better time to be a ""sure thing.""
Jennings is the man! Perfect BBF material! Heâ€™s a dirty-talker with a wicked tongue â€“ and he knows how to use it. Look at some of the sexiness that drips from his lips.
â€œKnees, love. I want to feel your warm, wet mouth wrapped around me. I want to see how much of me you can take and then Iâ€™ll dig my hands into your hair and urge you to take just a little moreâ€¦â€
Ummmmâ€¦.
These two definitely ramped up the steam factor! It was set to SCORCHING!
But that's not all. Theyâ€™re fun together. Although he's serious and sheâ€™s quirky, it just works. I also loved Violetâ€™s relationship with her twin sister Daisy. Theyâ€™re the cutest. I canâ€™t wait to hear more about Violet. I hope her story is up next because she seems like a lot of fun.
On the flip side, Canon and Rhys are a hoot. The secondary characters were a lot of fun. I can see potential spinoffs for several of these characters.
Soâ€¦great writing, flirty banter, awesome characters, and did I mention the epilogue. Gah!! This book has everything. I seriously effing loved it! Highly recommended for readers who love romantic comedy, fun and quirky characters, dirty-talking brits, and lots of steam!!

,"Nonfiction, Autobiography, Memoir, War, Military Fiction, Biography, Feminism, Biography Memoir",Jeanette,"This is MJ's story from her own voice. She's over the top enthusiastic and an adrenaline junkie. But she also cries buckets at times. Intense highs and ferocious lows.
But I hear the response here- ""hey, that isn't fair"". Yet it is true and because I do know she is quite a hero, that also makes her a natural for the work. Not only for her war flights and Taliban attack wounds events, but also with her honest and continuing attitude. Which encourages presently with petitioning legally within all the current organizational levels to get women into combat. Officially.
I'm not sure I agree with her on specific points at all, but I do know she knows what she likes and what paths she traipsed to get her Medvac pilot career. And that discrimination against women in the military (especially upon the personal sexual assault reality) continues to exist.
The writing had lacks and enough foul language that she could be a sailor. After dialogue response of expletive after expletive! It all sounds so dumb. But that's how they talk?
Well, I for one, found that the terrible incident of being knocked out of air space and being lost with nearly no fuel remaining because of the Texas A&M game glitch while she was just learning and didn't even know the navigation equipment or maps yet at ALL- that was just as brave as the others for the 3 tours in Afghanistan. Many would not have continued. Often I wonder when I hear about celebs or politicos calling off for ""spaces"" when highways, tollways, airports or spaces adjacent get ""shut down"" what fall outs actually do occur for the rest of us. MANY! And not all of them are safe nor easy alternatives.
MJ is certainly herself. And she has at a very young age, all the scars and redone joints to prove it. It's part of the process for those who love the adrenaline rush mode of living and push the physical. Never old bones intact.
The photos were 4 star and her story is worth the read. Hard row to hoe and I hope her future includes some measure of contentment. (less)",Netral
,"Nonfiction, Autobiography, Memoir, Writing, Books About Books, Biography",Emily,"I was tremendously intrigued when I first heard of this title, largely because starting in my early 20s, I kept a ""book of books"" of my own 
(and when I became active on goodreads in 2009 or so, painstakingly transferred all the information over here). Now that I've read Pamela Paul's memoir, I feel vaguely disappointed. I'm not sure sure what I was expecting. Really, how much plot can ensue as a result of keeping a list of books read? Did I somehow think this memoir would actually be about me? This is, in fact, a perfectly nice collection of essays about how various books shaped the author's life, or just commingled with it. Sometimes the lessons learned in each self contained chapter were a little too pat for my tastes, but I also felt myself wanting to talk back to the author about her reading, and tell her about mine, and it's pleasing to learn that the editor of the New York Times book review has such sensible thoughts about the value of all different kinds of reading.

,"Romance, Young Adult, Contemporary, New Adult, Fiction",Warda,"So, I wasn't sure where this story was heading at first. It was random, the family dynamic was messy and that's a fuckin understatement, but I decided to read on as usually with a Hoover book, it'll be gut-wrenching at some point.
And it was.
Not in the style of It Ends With Us necessarily, but in its own way. As I got more and more invested in the story, I teared up quite a few times.
I think Colleen Hoover is getting better and better with her books.
I like that there was a specific focus on family and mental health rather than just sex and boy-drama. It made for a nice change.
What I've realised and learned in this book is that I 'thought' the family aspect felt unrealistic. But then I thought to myself, what about the family made it unrealistic for me?
And simply, it's because I haven't ever experienced or seen anything close to such dysfunctionality.
I mean, it's fiction, but that doesn't necessarily mean that such a mess of a family doesn't exist just because I haven't experienced it in my 27 years of living. The secrets, the lies, the dishonesty is something that is all too real and I love how everything came together towards the end.

,"Fiction, Thriller, Mystery, Adventure ",Lindsay - Traveling Sister,"3.5 stars! This was an intriguing story with great characters, a suspenseful plot, intense action and an interesting history lesson.
This was my first book by Nelson DeMille and I really enjoyed his writing. Witty humour flowed throughout the story and had me smiling and giggling to myself. I really loved the main character, Mac.
I enjoyed learning about some of the history of Cuba/USA relations. I had little knowledge of Cuban history and politics so I worried that this novel might be over my head, but DeMille creates an extremely vivid story providing the perfect amount of history and background to keep an uneducated reader (like myself) engaged and following along.
While I did enjoy the storyline, I felt at times it dragged. For the first 65% of the novel, I found myself anxiously waiting for something big to happen. The suspense continued to build throughout the first half of the book, but there was no real action to keep me glued to the pages until close to the end. I was pushing myself to read faster to get to the â€œgoodâ€ parts. When the action finally did come, it definitely delivered - it was intense and almost overwhelming at times.
Overall, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it. It has sparked an interest in me to look into reading DeMilleâ€™s other novels.
It was a pleasure to read this along with my Traveling Sisters - Brenda, Norma, Kaceey, Diane, Susanne and JanB! Lots of great discussion!
A big thank you to NetGalley, Simon & Schuster Canada and Nelson DeMille for providing me with a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review!

,"Romance, Lgbt, Glbt, Lesbian",Jem,"This book is an unabashed homage to that most intriguing of character tropes--the uber-successful, all-powerful, untouchable ""ice queen"". No doubt inspired by the two most famous ice queens in lesfic fandom: Miranda and Regina. And of course, where's the fun in thawing ice queens if the thawer isn't one of the lowliest and least powerful underlings around?
I've noticed that the author loves to explore these kinds of relationship dynamics featuring such extreme power imbalances. Newbie vs Pro (The Red Files), Prey vs Predator (Requiem for Immortals) and now PA vs CEO. I've also realized how much I love such stories (no wonder all the books got 5 stars from me :) and never get tired of it.). I don't know....there's just something so incredibly compelling and satisfying about the whole idea of having an ordinary nobody finding the key to catching/touching/turning these cold, emotionally unavailable superstars into the, well, less cold and more human versions of themselves. The sheer impossibility of the task, the obstacles, the little triumphs, the setbacks, even more struggles and then the final victory -- the whole journey, is an adventure no less exciting than if they'd gone on a pirate treasure hunt. Yeah, I love these stories, and...I'm rambling. :)
Let's just say if you're a fan of ice queens, or of any powerful women in general, the synopsis alone will prove irresistible.
Elena Bartell is a self-made, billionaire publishing mogul. And she didn't get there by being nice. After being pushed out of a job that was rightfully hers by merit, she knows not to play fair. Keen business sense and a touch of ruthlessness has seen her sweep up failing publications and turn them into either thriving media or cold edifices...employees be damned. To them she is a soulless tiger shark, but the stockholders love her, and that's all that matters... at least to her. (Actually, that's pretty much the norm in many corporations where CEOs are paid to the high heavens for increasing shareholder value, so if she were a man, she'd probably be celebrated and admired instead of being stuck with a nickname.) Anyways...
Maddie, a recent NY transplant originally from Sydney, finds herself working the graveyard shift crime beat pulling double duty doing obits for a metro paper. When Bartell Corp buys the paper, everyone is put on notice to shape up or ship out. Ice queen Elena sets up office in the building, right next to Maddie's desk. And the dance and endless battle of wills begin...
Like Tarantino's homage films, the author takes a campy, over-the-top approach to drawing her characters, almost all of them familiar stereotypes (either they were inspired by the iconic 'Devil Wears Prada' movie or this was a former fanfic, take your pick) and imbues and magnifies them with the kind of larger than life personas that make them so memorable. And so delicious. The book is best enjoyed from this angle, as some situations feel contrived or preposterous. But ice queen fans would fall head over heels in love with the book, and Elena.
As I mentioned earlier, the main characters are all pretty stereotypical. But the reason why I loved the book is how deeply the author explores their psyches, and the lengths she takes to make her characters' connection realistic. Imagine that gap--a CEO and a lowly night shift grunt. It's not gonna happen overnight. Or even over time. It's going to take a lot of exploration, a ton of character growth and a huge dose of fairy godmother dust to make it happen. And that's what differentiates an exceptional author from a good one. Lots of lesfic authors can do the first two, but the sprinkling of fairy dust? Only a handful can weave the kind of plot magic that makes the cynical reader go, 'why didn't I think of that' , or 'hell, yeah' or 'awwwww...' No matter how unrealistic the plot is, the author makes it seem at least plausible. And it's highly entertaining to boot.
It goes without saying that one of the things that make the author's characters feel so authentic is that they never become someone they're not. There's change, and it can be huge and life-changing, but you don't undo 40 years of someone's personality completely and have it last further than the honeymoon. And yeah, I love that she gets her characters idiosyncrasies, and lets them be. But not after freeing the real woman trapped inside the ice.
It's important to note that this isn't a typical romance where 'romantic development' involves sweet, endearing dialogue or PDA displays, or whispered sweet nothings or even, the protagonists showing special care for each other. Every lesfic writer does that already. Don't look for it here. For a good deal of the book, it was either an awkward dance around each other, tension-filled exchanges, downright snark and talking in circles. Hence the need for 'the brutal truth'. In fact, the most romantic parts of the book are when they're actually thousands of miles apart. How weird is that? More often than I could count, their relationship was moving frustratingly one step forward and two steps back. The chemistry is off the charts, but there is just so much emotional and balance-of-power distance between them, not to mention the multiple layers of masks the ice queen wears. I figured it was going to take Maddie a lot to uncover those firmly welded-on protective masks. I didn't figure it would take almost the entire book. Well most of it anyway. As the masks had to be lifted off layer by layer. Well, I guess that's ice queen for you. And Elena is the toughest of them all. They'll never admit to emotion willingly. Least of all that most unspeakable emotion of all--love. That one word signals the ultimate 'melt', and no ice queen worth their salt will ever utter it if they want their reputation intact. Towards the end, when Maddie was trying to wrangle that declaration, I kept wishing her a mental 'hah, good luck with that!'. :)
In terms of how much I enjoyed the book, I should give this book a solid 5 stars, especially for putting my faith back in lesfic's ability to 'make my day'. But then there's The Red Files, and then there's Requiem. Ranged against such formidable opponents, a 4.95 will have to do.
But still, Elena Bartell earns a permanent place in my pantheon of earthly goddesses, joining the likes of Jessica Maddox, Mallory Spencer, Victoria Willoughby, Genevieve Fornier, Jennifer Lamont, Catherine Ayers and a few others whose names escape me for the moment but who live beyond the books they inhabit and whose exploits and personalities still manage to fill my thoughts...Women who focused on themselves and their dreams rather than love, who had to suppress a good part of their inner selves and acquired a discipline, a coolness and even a bit of ruthlessness, sometimes even losing a part of their humanity in the process, all in the name of success, and doing it on their own terms. It was such a joy to see them come in from the cold, their long suppressed selves unlocked... and how love is the secret key to it. It's just...magical.
4.95 stars

I was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved this book titled Chemistry! Author Weike Wangâ€™s unnamed narrator, a Chinese-American Ph.d. student, lives with her redheaded boyfriend behind her traditional parentsâ€™ backs. Despite the high expectations for their daughter to become a chemist, she is unable to be successful in her research, losing interest in her male dominated field and having difficulty making decisions regarding her career and her relationship. The boyfriend proposed but she is just not feeling it enough to say yes, yet she doesnâ€™t immediately say no. Caught in ambiguity, with nonscientific questions of the heart on her mind, and confusion about her future hanging in the balance, she searches inside herself to understand who she is, flaws and all, and how she fits in. Like an unsolved scientific problem, she may not be able to solve it and may choose to just ruminate. â€œBeing in limbo doesnâ€™t preclude us from sharing nice meals. In limbo, we still have to eat.â€
The narrator states that her vision is poor, and everything about her, her parents and her acne for example, seems worse than others. This, for me is a metaphor portraying how self conscious she is; a harsh judge of herself, while looking at others through a softer veil of judgement. Overwhelmed with her own situation, she shows little emotion to the outside world. Her approach to life is scientific, and a bit negative. â€œThe optimist sees the glass half full. The pessimist sees the glass half empty. The chemist sees the glass completely full, half in liquid state and half in gaseous, both of which are probably poisonous.â€ She is a realist, guided by proven fact and less by emotion and feelings; her life teeters back and forth while she is looking for a balance. â€œThe only difference between a poison and a cure is dosageâ€. She searches for happiness and presents to the reader how she feels about it with an equation:
â€œHappiness = reality- expectations.
If reality is > expectations, then you are happy.
If reality is < expectations, then you are not.
Hence the lower your expectations, the happier you will be.â€
Wang is a minimalist when it comes to verbiage; like a mathematical equation with no directions, she says only what is imperative, no flowery language or description but with an added touch of humor. It is up to the reader to read into the meaning of what is presented; her metaphors are fantastic food for thought when it comes to understanding the main character and her journey.
Written without names, the narrator could be anyone; an anonymous person in the midst of the struggles of life. I loved all the science references,metaphorical situations, and found this book most enjoyable. Chemistry is short but worthy of spending the time to read thoughtfully. It is satisfying in so many ways; a must read this summer with a unique style, thought provoking, heartbreaking and funny!

I love Tillie Cole and I love this series and I really enjoyed Riot.
You can read Riot as a standalone, but itâ€™s highly recommended you read the previous books since the previous character are heavily influenced in each book, especially this one and YAY!
I was really looking forward to this one because a lot of the story was set up in the previous book with 152â€™s brother. I also wanted to read the Heroine as the main character.
I love 152. I feel for her, I wanted to give her a big hug, heck throughout the book I was rooting for her to stay strong and keep on going. She goes through a lot and I liked that she doesnâ€™t have her memory so itâ€™s kind of a mystery and it keeps the story interesting.
Then there is 901. Heâ€™s the unstoppable champion and he has no weakness. Master will bring women to his cell, but he doesnâ€™t touch them because he knows better. I really enjoyed reading about 901. Heâ€™s the alpha male I crave for in a Tillie Cole read, but I liked the tension he brought to the story.
152 is suppose to become 901â€™s weakness, but he doesnâ€™t make it easy for her. I love how he pushes her away, but of course he is drawn to her. Like most Tillie Coleâ€™s reads, she really develops the characters and I like the relationship the Hero and Heroine have.
A lot goes on in this book and you get POVâ€™s from previous characters, so this is a nice treat for fans of the series.
This series isnâ€™t for the faint of heart and thatâ€™s exactly why I love it so much. My heart always aches when I read these books and itâ€™s a good kind of ache too. Iâ€™m emotional with the characters and they completely suck me into the story.

,"Romance, Contemporary Romance",Shelee at Book Reader Chronicles,"In the second book in a series about forbidden romances, Raw Need takes us into the very taboo romance of two people with everything possible pushing them apart. With a pregnant widow and the man of the brother who killed her husband, Lynn set up the story with as much angst and tension working against them as possible, but tempered it with the perfect amount of emotional care.
Rowan was difficult to grasp as a reader; at times it was easy to connect with her and become one with her, but other times she was quick to act out-of-character or without thought. Her position and predicament probably had a lot to do with that, one where she could not win no matter what she did, and I carried that frustration with me throughout the book. The animosity surrounding her in-laws became really difficult to read, but I felt it as I were her, wanting to fight through her and become her champion if she wouldn't be her own. Difficult as it was, it was easy to understand how well Lynn wrote the dynamic between a grieving family, all tied together because of one lost soul. Rowan's battle of grief warred with her needs and I craved that resolution, but the battle was half the fun (I mean, Zane ).
The connection between Zane and Rowan, though, was rife with delicious sexual tension. His gentlemanly ways lent well to his wild sex god demeanor. His sweet, caring nature made him a stand-out male character, one that you can easily swoon and pine over. His kind of affection can tear up the inside of your chest easily, and I adored him and his want of her.
Lynn always writes fantastically sexy books with great, well-developed characters and this was no different. Raw Need lived up to its name, building a great resistance and inner struggle with two people whose raw attraction to each other overpowered all logical thought. While there were random moments throughout the book that felt off or a bit cliche, almost as if Lynn was trying a bit too hard at certain angles, I still really loved this unique love story and thoroughly enjoyed the stomach-dipping need that surrounded these two. It was a truly beautiful and inspirational love story with a connection that defied the odds against them.

This short graphic novel picks up where the show left offâ€”Asami and Korra have left Republic City behind for a short vacation in the Spirit World. The art is BEAUTIFUL, and overall the story and pacing felt pretty similar to the show. A lot of the plot in this one focuses on showing Korra and Asami at the start of their relationship. Theyâ€™re becoming more comfortable with each other, and beginning to come out to their friends and family. We also find out that a couple of other characters are/were also queer, and I really appreciated how nicely inclusive the novel was on the whole.

Blush for Me is an amazing, lighthearted, thoughtful and sexy story! The third installment of the series, and I have to say, my favorite so far, tells us the story of Kat, the independent, sassy and overall kickass bar manager of our Seduction restaurant â€“ the setting of all the series -, and Mac, the handsome, caring, and charming wine tour businessmen and how a simple sexcation becomes so, so much more!
Kat meets Mac in her worst nightmare come true, her first flight, and he becomes her save anchor, grounding and calming her when that very thing seemed almost impossible. Even in this less than appealing scenario, they canâ€™t help but notice the immediate attraction, so when they are in their destination and realize they are spending one week together, they decide decide to enjoy it to the fullest, and Kat gets her sexcation, and they are more than happy with their no strings attached sexy times. Or so they thoughtâ€¦
Of course the plan falls flat when after that week they just crave each other more. So, for the first time in his life Mac decides to work for the attention and care of a woman, and Kat was more than worthy of that. It was game on!!!
I need to put some effort into it, and honestly, she deserves no less than that.
Romance just isnâ€™t on my radar because itâ€™s not something I do.
But Iâ€™m about to.
Kat had her own reservations, and doubts because of her past, but like the incredibly intelligent and rational woman that she is, soon she realizes that Mac is not just another men, and how could she not? He romanced the sh!t out of her! Swoon worthy, hearts in the eyes kind of romance! And reading Kat her sexy romances? HOT!!!
â€œIâ€™m falling for you, Katrina,â€ I murmur against her lips. Her eyes open in surprise, and just when I expect her to say something along the lines of this is moving so fast, she does what she always does.
She surprises me.
â€œItâ€™s about time you caught up,â€
Yes, they are both equally amazing, I canâ€™t decide who I loved more, because Kristen Proby created one of the best female main characters Iâ€™ve ever read. I adored everything about her from her rockabilly clothes to her sarcastic wit, she was AWESOME!!! But man, Mac is the romance hero dreams are made of! And OTT sexy to boot!
I want her. I never stop wanting her.
â€œSheâ€™s my life, Jake. Itâ€™s like I was just walking through life in a fog until her, and now I see everything crystal clear. Sheâ€™s put everything into focus for me. My life doesnâ€™t work without her.â€
Sweet baby Jesus! See what Iâ€™m talking about?!
Ok, Iâ€™ll try to restrain my Mac fan-girling now and say it was in incredible to see all the Seduction gang, and they give us some fantastic in depth moments, and a lot of hilarious ones (poor Riley, lol), and some heartwarming scenes. The side plot is well developed, and I loved how it flowed naturally without stealing from the unforgettable love story! Kat and Mac were perfect together and I canâ€™t wait to see more of their future in the upcoming books! And that snippet makes me wonder, who comes next? Mia or Riley? It can go both ways, and I want more Fusion NOW!!!
â€œI love you, but even those words seem too simple to describe how I feel about you. Itâ€™s an ache, right here in my chest, but itâ€™s an ache that you donâ€™t want to end. I look at you, and Iâ€™m calm. I hold you and Iâ€™m complete.
â€œLoving you, Kat, is like coming home, and itâ€™s better than any other feeling Iâ€™ve ever had.â€
â€œLoving you is what calms me in the storm, Mac. Itâ€™s the safest thing Iâ€™ve ever done.â€
â€œAs long as weâ€™re together, it doesnâ€™t matter the pace. Itâ€™s the journey, not the destination.â€

She was an unlikely obsession, this girl heâ€™d known for such a small amount of time. Were he asked under fire, he couldnâ€™t possibly account for the depth and certainty of his feelings for her.
I am so happy that I didn't give up on this book! It starts off really slow in the beginning and I planned to just skim the heck out of it to get to the end, but once I got to about the 30% point, indifference and boredom quickly turned to love and complete captivation. DONâ€™T SPEAK is a modern take on one of my favorite fairytales, â€The Little Mermaidâ€ It is quite a lengthy book but once the pace picks up, I promise you that youâ€™ll end up devouring this book like I did! I just couldnâ€™t put this one down and it is definitely one of my top favorites by Katy Regnery!
DONâ€™T SPEAK is the story of first love and forbidden love - how two people are able to look past social barriers and prejudices to be with each other. But is love enough when there is so much stacked against them?
Laire Cornish is a local girl from Corey Island, a small fisherman town in North Carolina. Her family and many of the inhabitants of this small town have lived there for generations. Sheâ€™s the youngest of three sisters and is the most dutiful daughter. Always going out of her way to help her father when he comes home bone tired from being out all day fishing. She offers to take a shipment of blue crabs up to the house of a client on the mainland so that her father can get some much-needed rest. It is at this gorgeous and expansive estate, that she meets the most beautiful man her eyes have ever seen!
Erik Rexford is what you would consider royalty of North Carolina. His father is the Governor and their family is one of the wealthiest in the area. He is immediately captivated by the beautiful girl with strawberry blond hair and freckles. Her innocence is refreshing and it also seems to put him under her spell. Erik is tenacious in his pursuit of Laire! Laire gets a job at a local restaurant on the mainland, which she had to lie about to her father because it is frowned upon for her to want to leave their hometown. But Laire wants more out of life. She wants to go to college, become a fashion designer, and leave her small hometown behind. Working at the restaurant also makes it easier for Erik and Laire to spend time together.
Erik and Laire keep their relationship a secret because they know their families would not approve and would end up doing everything they can to tear them apart. So the two spend whatever stolen moments they can get together. But then a terrible tragedy and an ugly lie end in heartbreak and years of separation for the young lovers.
Almost six years pass before the two cross paths again which seems to be fated. A lot has changed for Erik and Laire. Old feelings of betrayal and anger are still very prevalent. Can these two find their way back to each other or is it just too late?
What a beautiful love story! My heart broke for Erik when he was fighting so hard to hold on to Laire and not having any clue as to why she was pushing him away. This character was INCREDIBLE!

,"Romance, Humor, Funny, Contemorary ",NMmomof4,"3.25 Stars
Overall Opinion: This was a pretty light, funny, and sexy read. I liked it more than I thought I would, but it won't go on my favorites shelf or probably be all that memorable in the long run. It doesn't get all that deep into the characters, and we don't get any time with them as an actual couple (except for the epilogue which was brief). Otherwise, it was enjoyable and would be a good one for in between some heavier reads.
Brief Summary of the Storyline: This is Lizzie and Jake's story. The story starts when they meet again at work when they are assigned to procure items for a new exhibit at the museum that Lizzie works for. They had actually met before, and there are leftover sparks flying from that interaction. One night, Lizzie accidentally sends out a drunken rant about taking a strike on sex until she is treated well by the men she dates and it goes viral. Eventually a men's magazine puts a bounty to end her strike and things get a little crazy. In the meantime Jake and Lizzie heat things up, but Lizzie is hesitant because she is unsure of his motives. There are some funny dramatics, some sexy times, and some miscommunications...but they do get a HFN ending.
POV: This alternated between Lizzie (mainly) and Jake's POV (personally, I would've liked more from Jake's POV).
Overall Pace of Story: Good until the end. The end felt a little abrupt to me, but it flowed well and I never skimmed otherwise.
Instalove: No, they take a while to develop stronger feelings.
H rating: 3.5 stars. Jake. I liked him, but I wish he was a little more upfront with Lizzie about his intentions.
h rating: 4 stars. Lizzie. I liked her. She was funny, sassy, and took her mistake pretty well -- all things considered.
Sadness level: Low, no tissues needed
Push/Pull: Yes (view spoiler)
Heat level: Moderate. They have some moderate tension, chemistry and scenes, but not so much it takes away from the story.
Descriptive sex: Yes
Safe sex: Yes (view spoiler)
OW/OM drama: Mild (view spoiler)
Sex scene with OW or OM: No
Cheating: No (view spoiler)
Separation: No (view spoiler)
Possible Triggers: Yes (view spoiler)
Closure: This had ok closure with what I would call a HFN ending. I would've liked more time with them as an actual couple and maybe a (farther) jump ahead epilogue with some more concrete commitments for the couple.
How I got it: It was part of my kindle unlimited subscription.
Safety: This one should be Safe for most readers

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Thriller, Mystery, Fiction, Mystery Thriller",Jackie Law,"Where Dead Men Meet, by Mark Mills, is a tale of adventure, espionage and dark secrets. Set in 1937 Europe it introduces the reader to Luke Hamilton, a foundling who was adopted by a wealthy British couple and now works as a junior air intelligence officer at the British Embassy in Paris. When an attempt is made on his life it is at first assumed to be a case of mistaken identity. It transpires that little is as it seems.
The story opens with the murder of a nun who is clubbed to death in the English orphanage where Luke spent the first seven years of his life. Over in Paris Luke attends the Exposition Internationale where he is approached by Bernard Fautrier, a man he assumes is trying to trade state secrets. The currency of the moment is information but Luke has been warned by his employers not to become involved.
There then follow a series of assassination attempts which leave an alarming body count and Luke is forced to flea. Unsure who to trust, but aware that he is only alive due to the actions of Fautrier, Luke makes his way to Germany where he makes contact with a young women named Pippi Keller. At first she refuses to believe his story. She and her assossiates work below the radar of the authorities smuggling people and artifacts across the border and away from the Nazis. She has good reason to hate Fautrier.
When an operation is compromised Lukeâ€™s life is once again threatened. The action moves through Switzerland and on to Italy. Luke is being pursued by a variety of shady characters intent on his demise. When he finally learns why he realises that Fautrier is right and he has a stark choice â€“ kill or be killed.
The time period is well evoked with the threat of war and the undercurrents of distrust. With the benefit of hindsight it is too easy to judge but at the time there were many who saw potential for gain in the rise of the likes of Mussolini. The treatment of the Jews in Germany released ill-gotten wealth that plenty were eager to benefit from. The persecuted scientists and intellectuals were courted by England and America, aware that their knowledge and abilities could be used to gain national advantage.
Luke is a likeable hero with his vulnerability and reluctant bravery. Pippi is granted a strength that makes her an appealing sidekick. Despite the action and ever present danger there is an old-fashioned gentlemanly feel to the tale. The reader is transported to a fairly recent yet bygone era. An unchallenging but nevertheless enjoyable read.

,"Romance, Contemporary Romance, Contemporary, Marriage",Sharon âˆžâ¥ is an emotional book junkie â¥âˆž,"3.5 - 4â˜…'s
This is the story of Leo and Dahlia (Lia), a married couple, going through a pretty extreme rough patch. Lia's done about everything possible she can think of from asking for a divorce to claiming she was having an affair and nothing is snapping Leo out of it!
In giving an honest review, I have to say that this book was almost my very first DNF. I thought the beginning of the book really dragged and wasn't keeping my interest. I decided to keep going until we find out why Leo did what he did and then of course, I was hooked! Thank goodness!
And I really didn't like Leo at first either. He was pretty horrible but there was also something about him. You get a hankering of what his issue is but I just didn't want to believe it.
As you've probably read in other reviews, this book is about cheating...Lia does have an affair for all intents and purposes but the lines are blurred.
Fortunately, just as things are getting a bit heated, Leo comes to his senses and puts a stop to that nonsense. I loved the extent to which he went as well. He covered all the bases! Besides you-know-who pretty much creeped me out so there was no love loss there!
Leo and Lia's family were really sweet even though it was hard seeing the kids being affected by what was going on. Luckily, both Leo and Lia were sensitive to it and always there for them.
My heart really went out to Lia when she found out what was going on...and where! Poor thing! I think Dylan could have handled things a better even though he did take care of her a little bit.
Thankfully, she did find out because that's when things turned around. I could see how she could fall for Leo...he was so sweet and romantic. I probably would have liked him more if we had had more of this Leo in the beginning.
Still, Leo and Lia have a lot to work out. It was great how they managed to make time for each other...in a lot of interesting places! ;) But mainly, I loved how they worked out things together. (less)",Positif

Ladies, get ready to go on a romantic and laugh-out-loud adventure with the younger Prince of Wessco! I promise you this is a series that is guaranteed to have you laughing, swooning, and PANTING over the sinfully seductive Royals of Wessco!!

Emma Chase has successfully created another fantastic series that is sure to please her loyal fans and will definitely bring her some new adoring ones as well.
We met Prince Henry in the first book and have come to know him as the charming and carefree Royal who was both adored by his country and family as well. Poor Henry is now the next in line to become the King of Wessco, as his older brother abdicated the throne to be able to marry the American girl with no ties to royalty, who stole his heart. Henry is not taking the new responsibilities too well and has been doing his best to avoid his new reality by drinking himself into a stupor. The Queen takes pity on him and tells him to go off to one of their secluded palaces for a couple of months to get his act together. While he should be taking the time to learn the policies and laws of his country, he ends up agreeing to be the latest bachelor of the reality show called â€Matchedâ€. Twenty of the most beautiful single women of royal lineage will spend the next two months at his palace while competing for Prince Henryâ€™s heart. This is just an excuse for Prince Henry to have some fun and he has absolutely no intention of finding a fiancÃ©. But when he runs into the beautiful and shy sister of one of the contestants, he finds himself being completely bewitched by her.
Lady Sarah and Prince Henry have met briefly before and even back then there was a spark between them. Sarah is a Librarian and nothing gives her greater joy than her beloved books. Bronte and Austen are some of her favorites. Sarah is almost painfully shy and tries to not draw attention to herself but she unknowingly captures Prince Henryâ€™s full attention. He ends up spending every free moment away from the reality show with her. Sarah brings him a feeling of inner tranquility and her strong belief in him, inspires Henry to want to rise up to the expectations of the Queen and his country. But Henry is not the only one affected by this relationship, Sarah, who always tends to avoid situations that place her in the spotlight, has acquired confidence that she lacked for most of her life. Sarah is putting herself out there in what would be considered scary situations for her and finding her inner strength.
Henry and Sarah soon get entangled romantically and now the reality show becomes a nuisance for the both of them. Can Sarah deal with Henry continuing to be the star of a fake matchmaking reality show? Will she be able to trust a man that she has labeled a â€œWilloughbyâ€ especially when itâ€™s been her lifelong dream to end up with a â€œColonel Brandonâ€?

This is How It Always Is was well on its way to being a 5 star read for me. I LOVED parts 1 and 2. But after that, the book kind of fell off the rails for me. Part 3 just didn't seem to mesh well with the rest of the book. Part of why I liked the first parts of the book so much were the interactions between all the siblings and their parents. When those were absent for Part 3, it just felt like it was missing something.
I also felt like it all just wrapped up too tidy in the end, which isn't representative of real life. For example, while it was lovely gesture, would a 10 year boy really ask a 10 year old Claude/Poppy to dance and risk the ridicule of his friends and classmates? Seems doubtful.

,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Horror, Fiction",Heidi The Hippie Reader,"Down Among the Sticks and Bones is the back story of the twins, Jack and Jill, and the dark world they wandered through.
It takes place before the events of the first book in the series, Every Heart A Doorway.
The reader learns why the twins are so different and how their strange and disturbing other world opened its door to them in the first place.
The majority of the problem was Jack and Jill's parents. They had children for reasons other than love.
The father wanted to children to move up in his career. The mother wanted to improve her status with her group of female friends: ""A person may look at someone else's child and see only the surface, the shiny shoes or the perfect curls. They do not see the tears and the tantrums, the late nights, the sleepless hours, the worry. They do not even see the love, not really."" pg 13.
So, instead of loving Jack and Jill for themselves, their parents instead seek to mold them into a perfect of ideal of what they thought their children should be.
The one bright spot in the twin's childhood is their grandmother, Louise Wolcott. Chester and Serena, Jack and Jill's parents, call her in desperation after the birth of the children because they have no idea what they're doing or how to balance their careers while raising children.
Louise steps in without complaint. She is quite easily my favorite character in the book: ""There's nothing tiring about caring for children you love like your own,"" said Louise... pg 34.
Despite Grandmother Louise's best efforts, Jack and Jill end up fairly emotionally stunted from their parents' dysfunction. The twin's discovery of another world leads to some hard lessons about love, belonging and consequences.
""The Moors were beautiful in their own way, and if their beauty was the quiet sort that required time and introspection to be seen, well, there was nothing wrong with that. The best beauty was the sort that took some seeking."" pg 171.
I enjoyed this story. But, I think it should have been combined with Every Heart A Doorway.
I felt like so much of the plot of this book was given away in the first, by what happens. It would have been more enjoyable to learn about Jack and Jill's Moors in flashbacks rather than a separate story.
That being said, it is a good enough young adult tale for what it is. The fairy tale quality to it is undeniable.
Recommended for readers who like a dark undercurrent of emotion, coming-of-age and self knowledge in their fairy tales.
One may be better served reading this book before Every Heart A Doorway. I think, if I had read this first, I may have enjoyed it more. (less)",Positif

I picked up Never Let You Go by Chevy Stevens and barely put this book down after the story began. This is the first book I've read by her and I'm pretty sure I just found a favorite new author!
*This review may contain spoilers for those who haven't read the book*
At first, I thought for sure this was going to be another domestic abuse story like the movie Enough with Jennifer Lopez. It reminded me so much of the movie, but there's much more going on as the story progresses and it was impossible for me to predict where this story was going.
We start out with a newlywed couple that in the beginning of the relationship was your typical love story. Soon the wife, Lindsey, begins to see that something is not quite right with her husband, Andrew. He starts drinking and the relationship quickly turns abusive. What complicates it even more is that there's a child involved, little Sophie.
What can she do? She needs to leave and she can't figure out how she's going to do it. So, she drugs him, runs, and the result, something completely bizarre- an accident that will send her husband to prison.
The story from here on out is a guessing game that will leave you bewildered. I just couldn't figure it out. Just who is the perpetrator here? We have over a handful of characters and everyone is suspicious! I was so positive that this was going to turn into another Gone Girl with the way the story is so unpredictable. By the time I got to the end, that's about how I felt- shocked and had no idea!
I loved this book and I'm really excited to read more by this author.

,"Fantasy, Apocalyptic, Post Apocalyptic, Fiction, Fantasy, Magic",Kaitlin,"* I received this for free from the publisher *
This is a debut grimdark fantasy from a wonderful new voice to the genre. Not only is Ed McDonald a solid writer throughout the story, he also managed to get his dislikable character to be someone I stuck with throughout, despite the first-person narrative. It's not so much that Captain Galharrow of the Blackwing is a disagreeable person, as that he comes across as brusque and conscientious to a fault. He is a straight-arrow leader who is keen to uphold justice and is pretty confident about his place in the world, until Ezbeth starts to make him question...
In this world we have the Republic (home to Dalharrow and his crew) and The Deep Kings. The Misery is a dark wasteland of shifting perilous sands and nasty creatures that separates the two. The only other defence that the Republic have against the Kings is their Engine which hasn't fired in many many years, but when it last did it cowed the enemy so much that they have yet to return.
The creative set up of this world leads you to a fast-paced story filled with action and moments of adventure. Right from the start it's clear that Galharrow is about to discover some disillusioning truths about his homeland, and as the story goes on and other characters reveal the secrets to him, he quickly becomes enmeshed in a battle to restore the defences and sure up the retaliation.
This is a gritty and battle-heavy story which reminded me in some ways of Bradley Beaulieu's Shattered Sands series and Steven Erikson's Malazan series. I wouldn't necessarily say it fits into the same categories of fantasy as Lynch and Sanderson as the publisher have said, but if you like Abercrombie, Beaulieu and Erikson I feel like this will be a book for you. 4*s from me :)

,"Contemporary, Romance, Contemporary Romance, Lgbt",Mel,"Surprisingly for me, I didnâ€™t love the book. Until now all of the authorâ€™s books were 5 star reads and favourites of mine, but Small Change sadly couldnâ€™t live up to my expectations. Which isnâ€™t to say itâ€™s a bad book (as you can see from my rating) but I wish it would have been better. There are some aspects here that I really loved, some that I didnâ€™t like, and others that I am quite conflicted about.
I am delighted that the female/male relationship was awesome. There are no stereotypical gender roles regarding both Ginger and Christopher which is very important to me. I canâ€™t even tell you how much I appreciated this. Some books fall back into weird gender dynamics once the couple has sex but this was also not the case here. I enjoyed their sexual encounters a lot, because they were really hot and also realistic.
Gingerâ€™s bisexuality is another aspect of the book that I loved. Itâ€™s written in a very natural wayâ€”as opposed to being forced unto the page for representationâ€™s sakeâ€”and I also liked that her identity wasnâ€™t limited to being interested in both men and women, but that her whole identity is queer.
Ginger is a likeable character despite all her faultsâ€”or maybe because of themâ€”but I didnâ€™t quite fall in love with her. Christopher, on the other hand, is a character who is very easy to love. Heâ€™s hot (red hair, freckles, tall) and kind and very charming. However, I think that if it werenâ€™t for his brother Judeâ€™s side story and depression and itâ€™s influence on Christopher, he would be kinda flat and boring and too perfect. Maybe we will see more of Jude in future books but for the moment he felt more like an addition to the story to complement Christopher, like his purpose for existing was to give Christopher more depth.
The book rather appears as an assortment of intermingling different parts, more like a puzzle that is made to fit and not necessarily fitting in the first place. There is the coupleâ€™s (mostly Gingerâ€™s) individual journey, dealing with mental illness of a loved one, and the critique of sexism and misogyny (in the tattoo industry) that was too preachy in the execution for my taste. Actually, what I think is that this story is a bit forced. Like the author wanted to write about Ginger (because, clearly, she rocks), but then realised there wasnâ€™t enough to write her story, so things needed to fill the hole.
Additionally, this book was really too long and slow. I was boredâ€”not the whole timeâ€”but again and again. There were many details, long paragraphs, and I realise that this is kinda the authorâ€™s style and that it didnâ€™t bother me at all in her other books. I believe itâ€™s because I found the story itself lacking and the language less magical. The spark and wonder was missing for me.
But I havenâ€™t mentioned some other stuff that was pretty cool. While the book is written from Gingerâ€™s point of view, I really loved that we could read Christopherâ€™s charming mails to Jude, thus getting to know him and his thoughts a little better.
I also thought that there was no unnecessary angst which is how I like it. I also really appreciated that I didnâ€™t have to witness a family meeting with Gingerâ€™s mentally abusive family, and conflicts between Ginger and Christopher were solved in a satisfactory manner and not overly dramatic. Usually, that is. What Ginger said to Christopher in their â€˜big fightâ€™ didnâ€™t even make sense and was really hurtful and I really wasnâ€™t a fan, but thatâ€™s how fights go, especially if fear and anxiety are involved.
While Small Change wasnâ€™t as good as I had hoped and while I do have lots of complaints it seems, itâ€™s still a good book and read-worthy. Especially if youâ€™re looking for great representation of a bisexual woman, then you should definitely check it out.

,"Fantasy, Apocalyptic, Post Apocalyptic, Fiction, Fantasy, Magic",Rob Hayes,"This is easily the quickest I have ever got through an audiobook. I struggle with audiobooks. I'm very picky when it comes to narration and rarely find time to stick my headphones in and dedicate time to listening. I'm also not very good at just sitting still and listening, I need to occupy my body in some way while I'm at it. I got through Blackwing in a single week. I was finding excuses to ignore the world, stick my headphones in and listen. My house was cleaned twice; I even scraped the window frames clean and hoovered all the skirting boards. Blackwing made me do household chores just to have an excuse to listen. So I guess what I'm trying to say is... I loved this book!
At this point I'll mention that Blackwing is narrated by Colin Mace and he did an absolutely fantastic job. It took a few chapters to get the speed setting right as he leaves quite long breaks between paragraphs, but also speaks quite quickly. But his portrayal of the main character truly helped drag me in and I felt completely absorbed.
So Blackwing takes place in a sort of post apocalyptic frontier type of world. It might be termed as matchlock fantasy as there are firearms and odd levels of technology. It's set against the backdrop of a war that has been raging for generations. The humans on one side, backed by wizards called the Nameless; and the Drudge on the other side, ruled by ancient evils creatures called the Deep Kings. And between the two sides lays the Misery, a vast expanse of wasteland blasted by a cataclysm that tore open the sky and infected the land with malevolent magic. The things that live in the misery are monsters, warped by a magic that seeps inside and twists them about. It's fair to say the Misery lives up to its name.
Our main character is a delightful chap called Ryhalt Galharrow. OK, he's not delightful. He's harsh, cynical, nihilistic, violent, drunk more often than not, and a bounty hunter who will do just about anything for the right price. He's incredibly compelling and drags you right into the narrative, and then holds you under until you're seconds away from drowning in it. I'm fairly cynical myself, so it's fair to say I got on well with Ryhalt.
But before you go thinking it's all grimdark, with crappy people and a shitty world. It's not. Ed McDonald himself admitted there's a love story going on in there and the story is as much about hope as it is about cynical nihilism, with a fair touch of awe and wonder. And he's right. It's all delivered in first person, riding along in Ryhalt's head, and despite the fairly horrific things he's been through, despite the lot he has drawn in life and the terrible choices he has made, there is a kernel of hope buried in the center of his being. That he tries desperately to crush it at every opportunity only serves to make him even more accessible to the audience.
The plot zips along as a dizzying pace as Ryhalt and his interchanging crew are led on an investigation into the one thing that is protecting the humans against the drudge, an apocalyptic weapon that has sat dormant for decades. But don't expect it all to be straightforward. The author slaps the audience about with twist after twist and it's not until the end where everything falls into place that many questions are finally answered.
I'm struggling a little with the rating. I reserve 5 stars for something truly special. But I loved this book. I loved the setting and the characters, the magic system and the technology, the players and the masters their strings. I felt completely absorbed by Ryhalt's voice and the narration was stellar. So I'm going to cheat a little and give it 4.5 because I always round up! :D

,"Sequential Art, Graphic Novels, Historical, Autobiography, Memoir, Nonfiction, Biography, Comics",Negin,"I loved this graphic memoir. The illustrations are gorgeous, the story grabbed me right away, and the pain of the author and her familyâ€™s past was beautifully depicted. They were refugees who moved to the U.S. after the Vietnam War, but thatâ€™s not all that the story is about. There is far more to it than that. Itâ€™s a story of a family, rather than just the Vietnam War.

This is me before I started Say I'm Yours
I was in the mood for some major feels and stalked the 'Zon until I was finally able to download it. And yeah, I might've done that fancy jazz handsy move when it finally landed on my kindle. I'm peppy like that.
Unfortunately, my reaction after finishing Grace and Trent's story was a little bit of this.
I'll start by saying I enjoy Corinne Michaels writing overall and for the most part, my time spent back in Belle Buckle was good. My only real issue was, well, I guess the actual issues themselves.
Angsty situation numero uno: Forty year old Trent still won't commit to his girlfriend of TWENTY YEARS. No moving in, no I love yous. Nothing. He doesn't cheat but he does everything to keep Grace at a distance.
Angsty situation numero dos: Grace (please see numero uno listed above.)
I guess because I never really got why Trent refused to commit long term to Grace, I never really understood why Grace stuck around and took it. An explanation for Trent's personal relationship views was given but his treatment of Grace still seemed a little extreme.
And Grace? I'm not here to judge her for almost forgoing everything she wanted for herself personally. Love can make people do crazy things. I will say I still would've liked to have seen a little more backbone from her at times.
What would be righteously awesome would be a Cooper and Emily book. Cooper seemed almost too good for words in this one so I'd love to see how Ms. Michaels messes him up. (less)",Positif

,"Science Fiction, Dystopia, Young Adult, Science Fiction",Brooke,This book was hard for me to keep track of what was going on. It seemed to bounce all over the place. Maybe if I would've read the first story in the series I could've kept up. Don't know!,Negatif
,"Romance, Mystery, Contemporary",Ami,"Suspicious Behavior is the follow-up for Risky Behavior, which was released in May 2017. If the first book plays rather heavily on the procedural/mystery while at the same time developing the romance between Andreas and Darren, this book is more about the consequences of Andreas and Darren shaking up the department (and the city) while navigating their status as something more than professional partners.
Andreas and Darren are basically pariahs at their precinct now. No one wants to work with them because they are considered traitors. Cops don't rat out other cops. Both men resort to take a case from other precinct; cases that might link to a serial killer that has never been caught.
Urgh, I wanted to smack down the other detectives who make it difficult for Andreas and Darren to do their job. Fuc*king a$$holes! I really don't get the whole ""blue bloods"" loyalty thing. Those cops exposed are dirty, damn it! Or maybe I'm never really do well with authority who abuses their power :p.
As for Andreas and Darren, I loved that they were solid, despite the problems from work or Darren's family (as in his brother's declining health). I think this time the spotlight falls on Darren. He is dealing with the possibility of carrying the same early-onset Alzheimerâ€™s gene as his brother. Darren worries about that, and he worries that he cannot do his job well.
Previously Andreas is the difficult one, the jackass who doesn't play nice with his partners. In here though, Andreas accepts his relationship with Darren. He ... mellows a bit, I think. Repeatedly Andreas says that he wants to help Darren deal with both physical stress and emotional stress. He also comes forward about his health and relationship status with his daughter.
I definitely enjoyed the change!
The mystery is not as heavy as the first book; we find out who the bad guy is about halfway. I don't mind though, I enjoyed the change towards more personal plot. Plus reading about Andreas' interaction with his youngest daughter was ADORABLE!
So another satisfying read for me -- too bad I have to wait until next year to read book #3 (damn it!). I mean the BLURB!! It promises intense action!!

And that ending threw me. I was not expecting that.",Netral
,"Thriller, Mystery, Horror, Fiction, Mystery Thriller",Melissa,"Reminiscent of a slasher flick, Final Girls sticks pretty close to the typical script. All of the required components are thereâ€”survivor of a murder spree thatâ€™s barely holding it together, dead space where there should be memories, a person or two casting doubt, the hair-raising feeling that things arenâ€™t at all what they seem and most importantly, a leading lady that makes a ton of questionable choices.
Itâ€™s been ten years since Quincy and a group of friends were attacked in a remote cabin by a knife-wielding psycho and she was the â€˜Final Girlâ€™ left standing. As Quincy recovers her lost memories and slowly unravels the truth of what really happened all those years ago at Pine Cottage, it becomes clear there was one major detail that everyone got wrong about that night.
Despite all outward appearancesâ€”her baking blog, swanky apartment and relationship with a successful guyâ€”Quincy is a mess. Really though, after what sheâ€™s been through, who wouldnâ€™t be? Still haunted by what happened, she's prone to popping Xanax and washing it down with a swig of grape soda. My initial thought was that Quincy was doing the best she couldâ€”faking it until she makes it. I would even go so far to say I liked her . . . in the beginning.
Quincy, along with two other women that survived their own separate nightmares, were dubbed â€˜Final Girlsâ€™ by the media and garnered a ton of attention. Letâ€™s be honest here for a minute though, shall we? With social media making news stories like this so readily available, these chicks would have had their fifteen-minutes of fame and the world would have moved on to the next crime. There wouldnâ€™t be this huge media following 10-14 years later, despite one of the â€˜Final Girlsâ€™ dying a suspicious death and the other arriving on Quincyâ€™s doorstep. Iâ€™d expect some news coverage and maybe a Dateline special, but a front page spread and paparazzi . . . Iâ€™d say not. Have I mentioned, I struggle with suspending disbelief?
The author flips the timeline between the presentâ€”Quincy and Samantha on a downward spiral togetherâ€”and Pine Cottage. For me, it was the teens in the woods that held the most interest. I found the present chapters to be a little repetitive and slow; I was constantly waiting for something exciting to happen. A large part of my disdain resided with how unlikable I found Samantha to be and the fact that those feelings started to stain Quincy as well. I didnâ€™t expect her to fall apart quite so easily at the hands of this stranger, who was a complete wreck herself.
The story gained some much needed momentum in the last thirty pages or so, leaving me eager to confirm my suspicions. Despite all of the doubt the author had been casting, I was pretty confident I had in fact figured it all out. I'm happy to admit now, Riley Sager played me. I was completely wrong! Again, the author might have stuck to the proven slasher flick formula by pulling out a surprise ending, but it only helped to redeem the story in my eyes. Had it not been for that ending, my feelings and rating would have been drastically different. I have to disagree with the almighty Mr. Stephen King who declared this book to be the â€œfirst great thriller of 2017â€. Marketing hype aside, I would say this mild thriller is enjoyable for the most part, but not memorable.

for all you fellow thomas sanders fangirls, basically my very own patton and logan are having a fight
and yes, i do believe thomas sanders is the most precious gay to ever exist
here's a summary of the discussion i had with myself for the last 3 days since finishing this book:
heart: this was DELIGHTFUL AND ADORABLE
head: yeah but the story was really predictable
heart: elliot is a great pov, he is sassy af and charming and he feels like no one will ever love him even though that's all he wants and i just wanna cuddle him
head: true elliot might be great but all the other characters are kind of flat
heart: what about the fact that elliot constantly questions gender roles and is a super passionate pacifist?
head: that's great but all the topics the story deals with, like war/peace, gender roles, society's expectations, racism, sexism and so on were only touched upon and never really discussed, like it left me a little disappointed
heart: still the book was really funny, remember the many times we laughed out loud?
head: i remember, but nevertheless we have to admit that the writing itself was mediocre at best
heart: okay, let's get out the big guns, THE GAY WAS FANTASTIC, like look at the bi-rep??? elliot actually says ""i'm bisexual"" that has to count for something
head: and i loved that, i'm always overjoyed if a book has some good gay, but just because it does, doesn't mean we can ignore everything that was wrong with this book
heart: you cannot simply enjoy, can you
for real though, i finished this book and my first reaction was HOLY FUCK i love this so much??? but then i started to think about it and it actually has quite a lot of flaws. idk it often felt like reading fanfiction, not really an edited and published book. the whole concept of the book is great but the execution fell a little flat. from an enjoyment standpoint alone, this is a 5 star for sure, but it doesn't feel right to put it up in a 5-star shelf with writing brilliance like Shaun David Hutchinson, Leigh Bardugo and many more.
also sorry for this mess that is supposed to be a review, but i'm currently not capable of producing anything of quality

Written in rhyming text, the book is a great introduction for elementary-aged students (upper) to not only the Rolling Thunder Ride For Freedom but also Veterans Day and Memorial Day. There is some background knowledge that will need to be covered like the Vietnam Memorial, P.O.W. and M.I.A., etc. Still, the book hits a patriotic heart strings for me that few children's picture books can pluck.

,"Fiction, Contemporary, Literary Fiction",Jessica Woodbury,"This cover and this title and this marketing copy all seem like they came from a different book, a wry and witty look at single-by-choice life. But that didn't feel like the book I read.
Let me give a bit of my own perspective: I am single (technically divorced) and I am at a point in life where single-by-choice is sounding pretty good. That it is an actual choice I would make. I have put a lot of thought into this myself, which may be why I struggled so much with Andrea, the center of this novel.
Andrea does not seem to have made a choice to be single as much as she tends to grow tired of men shortly after they enter her life. You could certainly take that pattern and tell yourself, ""It feels like a long-term relationship just isn't for me,"" and feel comfortable and happy with that. But I never saw that happen. For me, being single as I'm approaching 40 has very much been about defining myself, building the life I want for myself, etc. But Andrea does not appear to have made many choices at all, and seems strongly uncomfortable with who she is.
There are very valid reasons for Andrea to have a troubled life and sense of self. But what I want to read is Andrea's story that starts just as this novel ends, just as she seems to start making progress. I want to see that Andrea. I want to see the Andrea that makes decisions. It was incredibly uncomfortable for me to watch her not decide things over and over again, to let things stay the same, to let friendships spoil and family relationships fade because she would not do something. The height of Andrea's refusal to go outside herself is her non-relationship with her severely ill and disabled niece, which eventually has her furious with her mother for going out of state to live with and support her son and granddaughter. There is much that is true here of people's fear and hesitance to attach themselves to the disabled and the loved ones who care for them. But it's also really brutal to read and I expect that people who have disabled loved ones or care for disabled people will have a hard time getting past that aspect of the book.
I'm sad that this was my reaction to the book. I wanted so badly to like it. I wanted to see some of the reality of being a single-by-choice person approaching middle age, and I don't feel like my frustration with Andrea is rooted in any kind of self-hatred. I wanted better for her than she seemed to want for herself. And I worry that people who come to this book expecting a rah-rah being single is great and fun are going to be blindsided by how much it is not that book. As for me, I tend to be more interested in stories of how people actually do make change in their lives rather than the stories of what led them to make the change. This book and I just do not want the same things. As a single person who dates a lot I am very familiar with this kind of relationship, where you meet and they are fine but they are not what you're looking for and you move on. (less)",Negatif

Moving on to the fans of Lauren Blakely: I can only preach to the Blakely choir! This novella was everything we love from a Lauren Blakely story and more. Fun, multi-dimensional characters, real dating relationship issues, meaningful connections, all of it, packed into a novella I won't soon forget.
I loved Dylan and Evie SO MUCH! Both as their own people and together as a couple. I loved the personalities that made them captivating individuals and I loved what they each brought into making them a dynamic couple. Of course, it isn't an easy road in realizing they were so utterly perfect for each other and it wasn't an easy admission for either one of them to accept the attraction and to take the leap but that's what made me love them even more! Life is all about taking those chances and living for the moment and few people make that so apparent in her writing than Ms. Blakely does. Kudos to her for reminding us to grasp every moment life gives us.

,"Science Fiction, Mystery, Fantasy, Fiction, Crime, Abandoned, Weird Fiction, Magical Realism, Adult, Did Not Finish",Mike,"I think this book suffered both from my misplaced expectations and a poor handling of genres.
In the first case what I expected to read and what the book actually contained were rather different. Based on the description I expected a detective/noir story set in a city with one part in permanent light and the other in permanent darkness. I thought this was a cool idea and would play well into the idea of a literal dark side of a city that is metaphorically prevalent in the noir genre. There is lots of space in this setting to work within the noir genre and push its boundaries in cool, innovative ways.
Instead of a gritty noir mystery this book contained a good deal of magical realism, a genre I am discovering I really just don't care for. Instead of a down on his luck gumshoe trying to track down a killer and save a girl (hallmarks of noir) in a realistic, if somewhat, fantastical setting I was instead presented with a magical dreamlike setting in Dusk (the growing area between the Dayzone and Nightzone of the city) where strange things happen can and do happen and where some sort of magic exists. Very little of this phenomenon is explained (thanks a lot magical realism!) and I am expected to just accept it for what the author tells me it is.
This is not a thing I can do.
If a book wants to present me some fantastical setting there is only so much I will accept as a premise. Half the city is bathed in a constant bright light while the other half is permanently shrouded in darkness? Sure, I can go along with that conceit for the basis of a story. But these conditions were explained and slightly explored with physical explanations given to how the city achieved this condition. Dusk (and the true driving force of the story) is left completely unexplained and takes A LOT of liberties with how reality works. There is no explanation given to why it is the way it is or behaves the way it does yet the book expected to just smile and nod at all the strange things happening. I didn't find Dusk interesting or engaging enough for me to ignore its lack of credibility.
The mixing of these two genres led to the second major problem I had with the book in that I felt that neither genre was effectively handled creating both a bad noir and a bad magical realism story at the same time.
On the noir front I think the biggest stumble was with the character of Nyquist. There were many aspects of this book that hit some of the high points of the genre: powerful men above the law with a shadowy agenda, family secrets that link to the wider mystery, a down on his luck gumshoe with a drinking problem who falls to far into a case, dames, etc. But where this aspect of the book stumbled was failing to deliver a suitable arc for Nyquist that made all other aspects of the genre nothing more than window dressing.
Basically the entire story is of Nyquist falling harder and harder into a terrible state, be it drinking, obsession with the case and the girl in question, or time screwing up his perception to name a few. We don't get a feel for what Nyquist is like before we see him with his descent already underway so there is no baseline to compare his state to. We get some vague hints about his past but nothing that fixes in our minds what Nyquist in a good state is to contrast with how far he has fallen. Further he doesn't seem to do anything particularly smart or unexpected, he seems to be rushed forward by events instead of being proactive about figuring things out. I didn't get the sense that he was worth much as a detective which made it difficult for me to care about what he was doing. In the end this book failed on the noir front because it did not properly frame the main character in a way that allowed the reader to put him in the proper context.
On the magical realism front, well, maybe it's that I just don't like the genre. I prefer my fantasy to be somewhat explained and not forced to accept it as is. For instance, in Lord of the Rings we are told why Sauron wanted the ring and why it was important. Not everything has to be explained (like why are there giant eagles? There just are, accept it as a small part of the story and move on) but the important things, the things that drive the entire plot of the book and exist in an otherwise realistic and rational world, need to be explained or else the story doesn't make any sense.
Why did Dusk exist and why was it so different form the rest of reality? This is never explained but in a world with at least an understanding and appreciation of science and the ability to KEEP AN ENTIRE CITY IN PERPETUAL LIGHT I would have expected A LOT more interest shown in studying Dusk since it was also a threat to said city. The fact that it is just treated as this thing that is out there and dangerous and no one seems to pay it any mind save for avoiding it struck me as completely unbelievable. Compound that with unexplained magic in an otherwise realistic world and the story really suffers in my eyes.
It would be one thing if Dusk was a minor part of the plot and its inexplicable presence and characteristics remained relatively sequestered from the main storyline but the last third of the book directly dealt with it and its consequences. The story put the poorly explained fantasy center stage and expected it to hold the weight of the narrative. This it could not do and each successive page added further to the amount of material the reader just had to accept instead of building on past explanations or reasonable foundations. By the end I begrudgingly accepted what the story offered just so I could get to the end of the book. This poorly realized magic realism aspect of the book collapsed under the spotlight and dragged the story down with it.
Now there were some interesting aspects of the book: the idea of people buying and living on different timelines, the dichotomy of the city and all the consequences of that, the neighborhoods within the different city spaces were neat and interesting. But the heart of the book, the fusing of noir and magical realism, was just a poorly executed mess and wasted so much potential of the setting and the story. So really your enjoyment (or lack there of) for this book will come down to how you view genre conventions because I could see how some readers could really enjoy the book. It just didn't work for me.
It did have a cool cover though... (less)",Negatif

Celebrating her new apartment at a local restaurant her eyes are drawn to a group of men that have walked through the door whom seem to dominate the whole room, her eyes are drawn to one man in particular, their eyes connect briefly and she can't help but notice how devastatingly handsome he is.
Authority and confidence emanated from him, along with an aura of danger. He moved with a grace, the others didn't have, the others walked, but he stalked in a sensual way. He moved like a predator. He was one of the best looking men I had ever seen.
This was a lot different than I had anticipated, in the beginning you completely connect with Addisonâ€™s character, Cole Mauricio is another story, so much mystery surrounds him, and for most of the story weâ€™re not privy to his background or anything so itâ€™s kind of like putting the pieces of a puzzle in the right places as youâ€™re given more information about him.
There are things about my life I canâ€™t share. Iâ€™d like to, but Iâ€™m in a position where I canâ€™t. Not until I trust you.
Danger oozes from him, and that comes through in the story, but as soon as Addison clapped eyes on him she was under his spell.
A few more meetings between these two and neither of them could fight their attraction, things escalated quickly, a first date to bed, and she's still in the dark of who Cole really is.
The author lulls us into a false sense of security in the beginning of the book, this is where I found it a wee bit drawn out, and slow going, it's not until you're over that half way mark where all the grit of what a good mafia read entails comes into play. And from that stage onwards I was invested into inhaling this as quickly as possible..At that stage I couldn't put it down..Things escalate, a few twists and turns had me gasping to see what the outcome was going to be.
If you're like me and are a fan of this authors then yes definitely I highly recommend a one click come release day, you'll also be pleased to get reaquainted with Carter Reed and Emma again so well worth a read..

,"Fiction, Contemporary, Lgbt",Jennifer,"â€œYou never know. You only guess. This is how it always is. You have to make these huge decisions on behalf of your kid, this tiny human whose fate and future is entirely in your hands. Who trusts you to know what's good and right and then to be able to make that happen. You never have enough information. You don't get to see the future. And if you screw up - if with your incomplete contradictory information you make the wrong call - nothing less than your child's entire future and happiness is at stake. It's impossible. It's heartbreaking. It's maddening.""
Ain't it the truth. When I was growing up, my father would always stress that there was no greater responsibility in the world than parenting. I think it was his way of relaying why he was so equally anxious and strict with me. But now that I am a parent, I get it. I understand it ten times over. I'm living it. Keeping a vulnerable and dependent human alive, emotionally and physically healthy, and safe from themselves and others will have the most confident person shaking in their boots.
This book is first and foremost about parenting. It's about the internal and external stressors of it all, and how there are no easy answers. An equally important layer of this book is the subject of gender identity and how harmful social norms in the US can be when an individual wants to explore who they really are, and when a parent wants to let them. This is How It Always Is is beautiful and heartbreaking. The writing is nothing short of stunning, and I was fulling invested in this reading experience. Absolutely recommend.
Note: I can see how this book may be controversial to some given the age of the child but I think this exact element showcases the theme of parenting that much more. There are no easy answers. Your bond with your child tells you one thing and society says another. I know which I would want to choose. â™¥

A brutal snowstorm has hit New York City like the back of one's hand. Unexpected and packing a full-out whallop. It's March of 1888 and there appears to be no glimmer in this Gilded Age. Nothing but the howling blast of wind and the treacherous streets of ice and mounds of impassable snow await these city dwellers.
Yet in amazement, two dark figures appear. Charles Linwood and his lawyer, Roscoe Conkling, decide to take on the storm through Union Square Park. Charles has just signed papers in regard to a marriage settlement in which he will marry Prudence MacKenzie, the daughter of the late Judge MacKenzie. Prudence waits anxiously for Charles to come to her home. Conkling makes it to the New York Club. No sign of Charles.....until days later.
A lone figure on a street bench is found with a deep wound to the back of his head and a playing card in his pocket. A tree branch that had unfortunately hit this man or something more sinister?
Prudence MacKenzie is indeed her father's daughter. She wastes no time in contacting Conkling and is introduced to Geoffrey Hunter, a former Pinkerton agent and lawyer. But like those impassable streets piled high with snow, Prudence must contend with her stepmother, Victoria, and Victoria's brother, Donald. There appears to be no fire strong enough to melt the heart of Victoria.
Rosemary Simpson presents a fine historical mystery here with all the layering of ""Upstairs Downstairs"" and the intrigue of Pinkerton's legacy of analyzing clues and situations. Human nature takes a spin through upscale homes, bawdy saloons, the tenements of Brooklyn, and streets of New York where hansom cabs deposit the good and the bad to their destinations.
I enjoyed this one very much. There are some dastardly drawn characters here. It appears that this may be the first in a new series by Simpson. If it is, I'll be tuned in for the next in a heartbeat.

,"Mystery, Fiction, Thriller, Mystery Thriller, Suspense",Miriam Smith,"With a very intriguing start ""The Child"" by Fiona Barton is one of those books you won't be able to put down until your curiosity has been sated.
This is an excellent example of a slow burning, suspenseful psychological thriller with an ending that I didn't see coming and was completely unexpected.
Baby Alice Irving goes missing from her maternity crib in hospital in 1970. Forty two years later a baby's skeleton is found by workmen on a building site in Howard Street. Alice's mother, Angela wants to believe it's Alice; Emma who was a teenage resident in Howard Street in the 80's is concerned a long buried secret could be about to be exposed and Kate Waters, a newspaper journalist hung up on the humanity side of the discovery of the bones, is determined to get to the truth of who the baby is by befriending both Angela and later Emma. Old memories resurface and it's not long before long buried secrets start to invade and destroy people's lives. Told from the point of view of the three women their stories intertwine perfectly and they seamlessly merge together in an intriguing and emotional conclusion.
I loved the 70's and 80's era that is covered in the story, being exactly the same age as Emma in the book at the time it is set I really felt a part of the story.
All the main characters are just perfect, likeable and realistic, they really showed true emotion and were the type of characters you could relate to and understand their feelings.
I like the authors writing style, it's easy to follow, entertaining, doesn't drag and truly keeps you compelled to keep reading.
With an excellent attention to detail and staying sensitive to the delicate subject matter, this is a fabulously executed book that I thoroughly enjoyed. There's also some great quotes too in the narrative.
This is the second book by Fiona Barton, the first one being ""The Widow"" and although newspaper reporter Kate Waters is in both stories, they are both individual standalones that can be enjoyed separately or together.

,"Romance, Contemporary, Contemporary Romance, Womens Fiction, Chick Lit",Jaime Fiction Fangirls Book Review,"My favorite of the series to date!!
This book started off making me very sad. The thorough examination of the idea that Artificial Intelligences could take over the need for human interactions is a scary and depressing idea.
It was scary and depressing because Penny did such a great job presenting both sides of the argument that, although I knew the side I would firmly stick to, still made question everything.
Yet again, Penny's smart romance sent me on a tailspin of information overload and made me feel highly unintelligent but thirsty for knowledge on something I might not normally even think about.
Beyond the thinking and the questioning she made me fall in love. She made me fall in love with Matt and with Marie and the very idea of falling in love itself.
There's something whole pure about the romance that Penny Reid writes. It's a sort of perfect fantasy that somehow also seems simple and real. And raw. I FEEL it when her characters fall in love. Down to my very soul, and when each book ends it's like the story has taken control of every part of me. The hardest part of finishing her books is knowing that the feelings I have at that very moment won't stay. Luckily for me the books live forever in my kindle and I can revisit them whenever I want.

,"Nonfiction, History, Politics, Philosophy, Writing, Essays",Jeff Dawson,"What a wonderful collection of absurd conclusions and utter hippocratic left wing garbage!
Iâ€™m not surprised so many liberals are clamoring, â€œYou Must Read this Before itâ€™s TOO Late!â€ Too late for what? The country being turned around and law and order restored on the streets? Or perhaps attempting to get the deficit under control and the economy back on track. No thatâ€™s not what they or the author are talking about.
Itâ€™s the dismantling of the Electoral College and the ousting of the current President. The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming! And not an ounce of proof to substantiate it.
Mr. Snyder does his best to compare Trumpâ€™s rise to power as the Communists and National Socialists came to power. What he fails to point out is the economic and political unrest in these countries that allowed those groups to grab the reins of power. Russia was bankrupt and the majority of the population were starving. They suffered horrible losses to the Germans in WWI and because of poor leadership and a starving populace, change was inevitable. Germany was in the same position in the twenties. Riots and lawlessness were common place. The Weimar Republic was helpless. The mark was worthless and unemployment was off the charts. And, the Communists, along with other political parties were attempting to fill the vacuum caused by the Versailles Treaty. Now, how is that like the current political and economic mood in the United States? Itâ€™s not! Unless you want to take in consideration all the violence that has been perpetuated on law enforcement officials for the last four years. Hmm. Didnâ€™t see the former President trying to call for law and order. He actually condoned these actions. Listen to his failed speech in Dallas, TX.
And, since heâ€™s railing about how corrupt Trump and all those are voting for him are deplorable, why no mention of the 5th column of the Democratic Party that formed after the Civil War in the states. Thatâ€™s right, the KKK. You want to talk about a militant, deplorable, lawless, corrupt organization that enforced the Jim Crow laws, you have no farther to look than at the DNC. Why no mention of the Wasserman fiasco and the sabotaging of Bernieâ€™s run? Well, that would take away from the esteemed authorâ€™s ridiculous claims. Doesnâ€™t that smell of tyranny?
Make sure you read this with an open mind. Why? Mr. Snyder isnâ€™t going to be at the forefront leading the charge. Heâ€™s left more loopholes for himself to be distanced from the anarchy heâ€™s proposing. If it doesnâ€™t turn out his way, heâ€™ll sit around the fireplace with his esteemed colleagues, sipping cognac and discussing how perhaps they need to perform more research while youâ€™re on the street bleeding for a cause you donâ€™t understand.

,"Nonfiction, Health, Mental Health, Self Help, Autobiography, Memoir, Psychology",Kate Olson,"(Review copy provided by publisher) FIRST, I'm going to tell you this: this book is NOT for people in crisis and is NOT for people with severe anxiety who are not working with a physician or therapist. It is NOT a recipe for ""fixing"" anxiety and it's NOT a cure-all (actually, it's not a cure-anything).
I went into this book with a strong affinity for the title and the concept of turning anxiety from an ugly beast into something beautiful, without completely obliterating the beast itself. And I did get that message from Wilson ~ that anxiety can be embraced and is a part of our unique personhood. I appreciate a lot of her thoughts about FOMO/social media/technology/social situations, and can relate so closely with so much of what she writes about isolating oneself in a time of anxiety. The unique style of this book is perfectly matched with the struggles that are described within the book, and the author tells us at the outset that it's not linear or organized. I read it much more as a memoir with some recommendations for things that MIGHT help others than as a self-help book. It is meandering and philosophical and disjointed - much like my brain, in all honesty - and I really enjoyed that it wasn't laid out like a workbook with ""here's how to fix yourself"". Because that's the whole point - Wilson doesn't think anxiety IS something to be fixed! Her thoughts on meditation and it not needing to be pure or perfect are much appreciated as well.
With all that being said, here is what could be potentially harmful for some readers:
Wilson is very vague about her actual practice at this time regarding medication, but does at many times throughout the book discuss going off meds with no medical oversight, and describes how she lives better unmedicated. While she of course can do whatever she wants with her own body, this book should NOT be taken as medical advice or a recommendation that unmedicated is the preferred state for anyone else. That is between any given person and their medical provider. Luckily she does admit that her stance is controversial and includes John Green's statement about NOT abandoning medication.
Her entire business was (she just shut it down - I think to focus on other things???) completely based on quitting sugar, and she is an adamant and vocal proponent of eliminating sugar from your diet. I won't get into my backstory here, but suffice to say that I don't agree with her on this and chose to completely ignore all references to it throughout the book. However, I'm far enough into my body kindness journey that I am able to do that. If you are at all susceptible to diet culture, this could be harmful to you, so please be cautious.
Wilson is not at all shy about her fear of being fat, and while she does not at all admit to this in the book, my years of reading and work on this issue are telling me that she has an eating/body image disorder, and I deeply hope that she finds peace with herself in her lifetime. If you are vulnerable to messages such as this, and would be negatively impacted by mention of fat-phobia, I would avoid this book.
The reason I settled at 3 stars for this book is because of the raw and open nature of Wilson's story and her willingness to admit just how flawed she is. She isn't presenting this book as a ""look, I'm fixed! Here's how I did it!"" manual. She's telling things that have worked for HER and offering them up to readers, within the context of her very personal journey. I hope I have given you helpful guidance in whether you should be one of those readers :-)

,"Fantasy, Mythology, Young Adult, Childrens, Middle Grade",Hannah,"The good thing about Rick Riordan's books is that you always know what you get. They are light-hearted, funny, fast-paced, and just lovely to read. Having said that - I think he might be running out of steam here.
I will not even try to give a synopsis because, like all the books in the Percy Jackson universe before this, it's basically: group of demi-gods (or Einherjar) get send on a quest, they go from place A to place B - get attacked/meet a monster/get challenged - escape, go to place C - get attacked/meet a monster/ get challenged - escape, go to place D - get attacked/ meet a monster/ get challenged - and so on and so forth. The recipe works; the books are all insanely readable and fun but, especially the later ones get a little bit stale. Not enough that I stop reading them, mind, but enough to make me hope that Rick Riordan will actually manage to wrap them up sooner rather than later so that they can end on a high.
What I love about these books is how obviously aware of his readers Rick Riordan is - and he tries to write characters that many people can relate to. I find that especially important in Middle Grade books. He seems to have such a lovely, positive world view and his books reflect that. They always emphasize friendship and being there for each other and being a good person. I like that.
I think one of the reasons this book did not quite work for me is the fact how very dark the underlying mythology is: don't get me wrong, the Greek pantheon is filled with dark and twisted tales but also with goodness and hope, Norse mythology? Not so much. It is filled with the knowledge that the end of the world - Ragnarok - is inevitable. And this grimness does not quite mesh with the light-hearted voice of the series.
But still, I enjoyed reading this book and spending more time in this world that feels familiar, it is comforting to know exactly what to expect and I needed that.

,"Mystery, Fiction, Thriller, Crime, Mystery Thriller",Jim,"Readers familiar with the Prey series know that Lucas Davenport left the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) and is now a U.S. Marshal. I am still trying to adjust to this change ... as is Lucas. This new career came about after he saved the life of a candidate for President. In effect a political appointment. There are others in the service who resent his coming in ""from the top down"" rather than having had to work his way up. Another adjustment is he now has to work anywhere in the country rather than just Minnesota or a neighboring state. It can be a cultural adjustment. As in this story where the case he works is in the South.
Lucas is looking for something challenging and he finds it when a pair of robbers, known as the Dixie Hicks, knock over a Biloxi, Mississippi drug-cartel counting house. In the process they kill five people, including a six-year-old girl. The cartel wants their money back and Lucas and the assassins are in a race to get the Dixie Hicks. Neither the robbers or the assassins, including a torturer known as the â€œQueen of home-improvement toolsâ€, care who gets hurt along the way.
This story features John Sandford's usual, sometimes, dark humor and gruesome details. We are also introduced to some new characters who sound like they may appear in future Prey novels.

In the latter years of the sixteenth century, the professional theatre as we know it was born. Prior to this time there were plays and actors, but the companies had nowhere to perform other than inns, parish halls and some of the great houses, until permanent playhouses were built in London.
It's here that we make the aquaintance of Richard Shakespeare, an actor struggling to make a living in the shadow of his older brother William. There's no love lost between the brothers. William seems to take great joy in ridiculing Richard, and as the popularity of theatre increases, so does the rivalry between the brothers as well as the various playhouses, playwrights, and actors. These rivalries lead to some underhand dealings, and they also introduce us to some pretty nasty characters along the way.
There's no doubt that Bernard Cornwell writes with great skill, and he really brings the Elizabethan era to life. It needs little imagination to walk the streets of 16th century London, such are his literary talents. However, I found it really difficult to invest in any of the characters. The storyline focused on Richard, leaving William very much in the shade, and naturally, because of this, Richard was definitely the most fleshed out, the most interesting of all the characters, but unfortunately it didn't really work for me.

Ugh! As the absurdity continued chapter after chapter after chapter, I wondered aloud if some semblance of reality would make an appearance. Never did! My brief encounter with Made for Love was unrelentingly maddening and interminably frustrating. What was the point?
Buried somewhere in this crazy insane piece of work is social commentary (I think!) on love and relationships in a society dominated by technology. Laced with satire, sarcasm, wit and a few pinches of irony and mockery thrown in for good measure, I could never quite fit all the pieces together into a coherent and intelligible moral to the story. Intended and unabashed deadpan humor? Possibly. Maybe. Could be. I donâ€™t know!
Nutting expertly challenged our assumptions about child sexual predation in her literary debut Tampa, successfully forcing the reader to ponder some fundamental societal beliefs. The sex was graphic. The point well communicated.
It feels like Made for Love attempted a similar exploration of some of our core beliefs and expectations but it never quite brought home the point for me. Sex plays an important role in this book too. The story opens with sex doll relationships, explores abstention from sex, casual and occasional sex and even introduces the reader to dolphin sex fetishism (think of all the crude jokes and coarse innuendoes about a man and the blowhole! snicker, snicker ...) A company named Gogol (a nod to the ubiquity of Google?) along with the embedded microchip that data dumps daily provides the symbolism for technological domination over free will â€¦ I think!
Donâ€™t get me wrong, I love a good piece of satire that pokes fun at the craziness of modern life and Nuttingâ€™s writing was excellent. But the point of Made for Love was lost on me, the message hidden under an Everest of absurdity. Maybe the absurdity of modern life is the point. I just donâ€™t know.
I did laugh out loud several times during the story and for that reason Iâ€™m rounding my rating up to 2 stars. If not for the occasional chuckle, this was a one-star read for me ... it was a story to nowhere. Good writing; unknown destination.

After a typical day in a typical American high school, five teenagers enter detention but only four make it out alive. Simon, notorious due to his gossip-style blog that revealed all the dark and dirty secrets his fellow students never thought would see the light of day, had made many enemies. But which one would want to see him dead?
The multiple perspective all provided their own angle to the plot. These all pulled together, towards the end, to turn their individual stories into one cohesive whole. Each dirty secret that was uncovered made each character less of a walking stereotype and more of a flawed, and therefore real, individual. I will admit that when I first was introduced to this cast of characters - the overachiever, the bad boy, the jock, the popular girl - I had assumed these were going to be nothing more than a set of weakly constructed and overused cardboard characters. How wrong could I be?
The actual plot was a thrilling and interesting one, but it was the characters who circled it that really compelled me to keep reading. I admit that I figured out the mystery pretty quickly, but this didn't detract from my enjoyment in any way, purely because the characters.

5 â€œred balloonsâ€ stars
I tried three times to write this review. I was always erasing and changing trying to make it better. Until I realized it did not have to be perfect. Like the heroes my review will have flaws because I could never compare to Emma Scottâ€™s writing.
So what?
I will follow a beloved authorâ€™s advice: write like no one will ever read you. That way youâ€™ll be true to yourself.
First of all I loved the book.
Emma Scott is now right alongside authors like Amy Harmon, Suanne Laqueur, Brittainy C Cherry, Leylah Attarâ€¦in my personal pantheon of exceptional writers. These ladies are all gifted with graceful writing.
Reading The Butterfly Project was like watching the movie Love Actually: deeply moving, in technicolor with faultless cast.
Emma Scott has used many common romance tropes: two lost people who will help each other after a random but fateful encounter. Life has taken its toll on them. Theyâ€™re broken and riddled with guilt. Itâ€™s filled with romantic moments and good feelings. It could have been too cheesy and eye roll inducing but Emma Scott never fell in the trap of overdoing it. On the contrary it was beautiful, moving, inspiring â€¦ just right.
Thatâ€™s the trademark of a very gifted author and I would die to meet her as I bet the woman must be an incredible lady as well.
She just ripped my heart and I still want to thank her.
I loved her writing. I was IN the moment, walking in the characterâ€™s shoes. I was not reading about Zelda or Beckett. I was them.
I was overcome by the Christmas tree beauty on Time Square. I was warmed all over, trapped in a bubble of happiness while swaying gently on Sinatraâ€™s song. I could not breathe when I had to go home because it reminded me of my shortcomings. What I didnâ€™t do to save her. I was living time and again that frozen moment when my actions caused death. I was elsewhere, not on the train commuting to work, not on my sofa notâ€¦ but somewhere in a dingy studio in Brooklyn, sleeping on an air mattress.
Characters are a crucial element in a book. I have to be able to connect with them, to understand their motives, their flaws, their strengths and weaknesses. The Butterfly Project has an incredible set of characters main and side characters. Beckett is the ex con you would never expect. He was selfless, good at heart, courageous, supportive. He reminded me not to judge people on their actions. Mistakes happen you can stumble along the path. Some bad action does not make you evil. Everyone has a right to forgiveness and second chance.
Forgiveness takes center stage in this story: forgive yourself and forgive others. Thatâ€™s the only way to be free and go on.
Zelda was a very endearing and relatable heroine. I loved her as graphic artist. This is the third book revolving around artists and I love Emma Scott to pieces for choosing to put the spotlight on artists. I love drawing and creating in general and I know how hard it is to live from its craft. What Zelda did to pursue her dream was very brave. It was also vital for her to publish her story as it was a tribute to a loved one.
Zelda and Becket had nearly nothing. They worked two jobs and lived in a tiny freezing studio and yet they never had been happier. They were not alone anymore. They were alike, supporting each other. Because whatâ€™s most important in life is not wealth or possessions but love.
So itâ€™s been a â€œfeel good â€œ book written with great talent and a true heart. I canâ€™t recommend it enough.
Some of my favorite quotes:
â€œLie down with me on the ice again. Look up at the tree. All the lights in the branches, straight up over your head. Be there.â€ â€œYouâ€™re there, too?â€ â€œRight here.â€ A long, breathing silence. â€œHow do you do that, Beckett?â€ â€œDo what?â€ â€œI called you feeling so goddamn lost, but your voiceâ€¦ Itâ€™s like a searchlight in the fog.â€ â€œIâ€™m right here,â€ I said. â€œ
â€œI wear the words like chains around my neck. Felon. Criminal. Prisoner. Iâ€˜m all those things, and remain them, even after time served. A freed prisoner with a life sentence. Now I have a woman in my life whoâ€™s turned everything that was cold and gray into warmth and color. Sheâ€™s inked new words onto my heart. Us. Together.â€
â€œDo you ever wonder, Zelda, if youâ€™re allowed to be happy?â€ Tears sprang to my eyes. â€œYes,â€ I whispered. â€œAll the time. Every minute.â€
â€œForgiveness. The word was a whisper in my mind. If I were drawing it on the page, it would be written in small letters but contained in a large thought bubble. Eleven tiny letters floating in a sea of white. Like a balloon. A red balloon and a childâ€™s smileâ€¦ â€œ

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Holiday, Christmas, Fiction, Romance, War",Crystal King,"This book is still sitting with me a month after I read it. I have to admit, I was skeptical of a book told only in letters; it's extraordinarily hard to pull off the thread of a plot with such a device. But Hazel Gaynor and Heather Webb are an incredible force when paired together and the characters in this novel lept off the page in full, vivid color, wrapping themselves deep in my heart. I found myself rooting for the characters, teary-eyed when things didn't go like I had hoped, and full of emotion with every new letter that appeared. I especially loved Evie and her bright, often naive, optimism.
This is a beautifully rendered love story which would make a fantastic gift at Christmas (or anytime!). Loved, loved, loved it. (less)",Positif
,"Sports and Games, Contemporary, Romance, Novel",Jennifer Zorko,"If you are anything like me you love a second chance at love, you also appreciate HOT heroes and strong female character. That is what you get in Deep Check, but so much more.
Finn and January had been friends forever, part of the three amigos, until one very stupid night when January kissed him, he kissed her back and their best friend saw it. It caused a rift between the friends, caused Finn to blow January off, and made him run from Remington, but never, ever has he forgotten his friends. He always thought that he would have time to make things right, but when his best buddy is killed in a fire, he lost the chance to make amends. When he finally reaches his dream of winning the Hockey Cup, he knows what he needs to do, take it to his friends grave and finally try to put away the ghosts of the past, and that means making amends with January too.
January has been in love with Finn for as long as she can remember, when he returned for the funeral, he was there a day and then ran for the hills, but now he is back in town, looking as hot as ever and making January remember all too well exactly why she fell in love with him. But she knows it it temporary, that he will be leaving soon. When he decides to fix up his old home to put on the market, January and her firefighter friends jump into help. When Finn helps January with her fund raiser, she is stunned, and over the moon.
But sometimes that ghosts of the past can sneak up on you, and Finn will need to decide if risking it all to be with January is a risk he is willing to take.
AMAZING! OUTSTANDING! HOT! Kimberly Kincaid does it again, pairing this amazing hockey story with her Station Seventeen series. I loved that we get to see friends from the other Stations Seventeen book, and I love the chemistry between Finn and January. This may be a novella, but trust me, it reads like a full length 300 page book. Fast paced, while not being short on content, this book is an amazing addition to the Station Seventeen series.

I don't know what I'm more upset about... the waste of my time or my money. I can't believe I paid for this book nor that I actually finished this book.
Despite not being super hype for this book after I read book #1 in this duet... the first book was OF COURSE a cliffhanger. I really hate this ridiculous S-T-R-E-T-C-H of stories that seems to be the norm nowadays. Seriously, this story didn't need more than the first 25% of this book to wrap up the duet. On top of this ridiculous story extention, the two MCs spent the vast majority of this book... 80+%(?)... apart. WTF?!
I cannot believe the amount of inner dialogue going on in this book. I thought the 50 Shades trilogy was littered with too much inner yadda yadda... no, no, this takes the cake. It mostly went something like this...
Person 1: ""Dialogue""
2+ pages of inner thoughts
Person 2: ""Answer to Person 1 dialogue""
2+ pages of more inner turmoil and reflection
Person 1: ""Answer to Person 2 dialogue""
Seriously?! Conversation stunting at it's finest!
And, let's just slop some icing on that cake why don't we. (view spoiler)

,"Romance, M M Romance, War, Military Fiction, Contemporary",Bitchie,"I don't know what it was here, but something was off.

I expect better for the price.
It was nice though, to read a book where the focus isn't all about the buttsex. Especially coming from LA Witt, there weren't a lot of sex scenes, probably because with Travis' limitations, there's only so many ways you can write a blow job or a hand job. I only kind of missed it, lol!

,"Nonfiction, Autobiograpgy, Memoir, History, War, Biography, Christian, Biography Memoir",Fizzy,"I was born in August of 1975 (dating myself). The Vietnam war had just ended but life wasnâ€™t even remotely back to normal, for anyone involved. I was the first baby, the greatly anticipated baby, and apparently Ma was a bit overprotective. I was the only kid I knew growing up who had a small pox vaccination scar. Ma was so worried about the idea of what â€˜couldâ€™ happen with the influx of refugees that she wanted her precious child protected. The way it was told to me was that the vaccine was special ordered and sent in from the CDC to the Greene County Health Department just for me. My younger sister didnâ€™t get such treatment, but she didnâ€™t come along for another 17 months after I did. Imagine, if that is what a parent in somewhat isolated Ozark Mountains of Missouri does when she fears for her child in the after effects of this war, what parents who lived it with their children went through. Parents who listened for and watched bombs drop. Parents who couldnâ€™t protect their children from the effects that war has on a country, and community, and family and even the world. Imagine watching your child ignited by a â€˜bombâ€™ from the sky and believing that your child is now gone forever.
This book isnâ€™t about Kim Phucâ€™s parents, itâ€™s about her. Her parents figure into her story obviously, but we donâ€™t know really know how they felt or their inner turmoil that would have fueled their reactions. We do know what she felt and what she went through. Call me woefully ignorant but I wasnâ€™t familiar with the picture that made Kim famous. Taken and made famous before my time, about a war Iâ€™ve had little opportunity to study, this picture changed the life of this girl (now woman) in ways I canâ€™t begin to imagine. From growing up in the â€˜freeâ€™ south of Vietnam to falling under the communism rule when the north won the war. From waking up burned in a hospital morgue to spending the rest of her life dealing with the long term effects of napalm. Through all of this she searched for peace. She gave up her childhood dreams of marriage and family, telling herself that no one could love her scars. She gave up her dreams of an education when the â€˜handlersâ€™ continuously took her away to sit for staged interviews with staged responses. She gave up her dream of being saved by the faith of her family CaoDai (which Iâ€™d never heard of) and came up lacking. Somewhere along the way she was introduced to Jesus. With a lot of encouragement, patience and learning she gave her life to Christ one Christmas Eve. The question begs, if she had never encountered the things that changed her life would she have found herself in need of Christ? Would she have been open to needing to find peace. Peace from physical hurts, emotional hurts, and lost dream hurts.
Kim Phuc has gone on from that picture, those interviews, and those feelings. She did find love, in Cuba where she was sent to attend school. She did find freedom to set her own course and schedule her own interviews when she and her husband defected to Canada on their return from a Moscow honeymoon. She did find dreams when she carried two amazingly healthy, loving sons. She did find peace when she reunited with her parents and not only brought them to the feet of Christ but also helped them to defect to Canada. Kim went from resenting the girl in the picture to embracing who that girl allowed her to become. This book is so much more than a memoir of war and hurts. Itâ€™s a memoir of finding peace in all circumstances.

I try to read as many books as I can about podcasts, podcasting, interviewing, etc., so I was excited to see this book come up. I used to listen to the WTF Podcast, and still do occasionally when the guest is someone who really interests me. I think, at times, Marc Maron asks interesting questions, and I was curious to hear more about his thought process. That isn't really represented in this book much, although there are tidbits here and there. In the Addiction chapter, his brief intro explains why he asks about addiction if he has that in common with his guest. This is one of the reasons I stopped trying to listen to all the episodes, honestly, but I found that he has a very good reason for doing so - something about when someone connects with you on a shared experience like addiction, it somehow strips the pretense away and allows him to get deeper and more personal about other topics. As a listener not all that interested in addiction though, I would often get frustrated when he got to these moments!
So if you have heard every episode of WTF, there will not be any new content here. What he has done is cull the interviews for thematic content and organized them so they create a rough narrative in the sense that the first person might mention their father and then religion and the next quote might be about religion and move to the next topic. It takes skill to organize bits in this way, so I respect that. It made it enjoyable to read, even though some of the excerpts were revisiting stuff I'd already heard.
There is not a lot of man-behind-the-curtain stuff like I was hoping, but enjoyable just the same. There are a few people I started skipping because I found I didn't particularly care for their flavor (I do think that people have certain expectations about what will happen when they sit down in a garage with a comedian and have a hard time getting beyond masturbation jokes), but your mileage may vary.

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction, Cultural, China, Audiobook, Asia, Adult, Adult Fiction, Book Club",Mary Beth *Traveling Sister*,"This book was way out of my genre and I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. It was so beautifully written and I got to experience a Lisa See book. It was a wonderful experience. This is a historical fiction book of the culture of China. I got to learn a lot about their beliefs and superstitions. When I saw the title of the book I was attracted to it since when I was younger I lived on a street called Hummingbird Lane.
The story starts out about a young girl named Li-Yan who starts a relationship with a boy named San-pa. The parents don't want them to be together in marriage due to their birth signs, San-pa was born on a Tiger Day. Li-Yan was born on a Pig Day and this was uncalled for in their heritage.
Li-yan becomes pregnant and San-pa doesn't even know this since he is in Thailand at the time. Li-yan ends up having the baby but takes it to a house in a basket with a teacake. The family reports it, then the baby is adopted in America.
After mother and daughter have gone their separate ways, Li-yan slowly emerges from the security of her village to encounter modern life while Haley grows up a privileged and well-loved California girl. Despite Haleyâ€™s happy home life, she wonders about her origins; and Li-yan longs for her lost daughter. They both search for and find answers in the tea that has shaped their familyâ€™s destiny for generations.
The second half of the book goes into detail of the tea making and cultural beliefs of the Chinese.
I highly recommend this book to those that love historical fiction. Also to those that love to learn about cultures of another Country, China.

,"Fantasy, Paranormal, Demons, Angels, Roamance, Fantasy, Dark",Annie,"4.5 stars- The intrigue and excitement just keeps building
Wicked Ruin is the third book in the Se7en Sinners series and definitely shouldnâ€™t be read as a standalone. Dealing in a fantasy world full of paranormal creatures, some religious imagery and connections, and featuring demons and angels, the series continues to deliver an epic tale packed with exciting action and intriguing characters.
In the second book I grew a little restless and disappointed in Edenâ€™s character shift and portrayal, so I wasnâ€™t quite sure what to expect from Wicked Ruin. I was utterly pleased that the spunky, self-sufficient side of Eden reemerged. As in the previous books, her chemistry with Legion is undeniable and even as they face an uncertain future, you can feel their magnetism. Equally interesting were Edenâ€™s relationships with other characters- including Lucifer, Nikolai, Crysis, and the other Se7en. While I wasnâ€™t crazy about the Lucifer vs Legion for Eden plotline in the second book, the story arc felt more complete in this book and kept things interesting. Miss Jenningsâ€™s books regularly feature excellent dialogue that flush out her characters and bring the scenes to life and Wicked Ruin is no exception. And of course, if youâ€™re looking for steam, you wonâ€™t find this series lacking one bit.
Honestly, three books in and Iâ€™d typically worry that a series would hit a repetitive point or rely on overdramatizing every conflict. But that hasnâ€™t happened in this series. The world Miss Jennings continues to craft is complex and her characters vivid with interesting backstories, unique abilities, and complex temperaments and personalities. I never quite know how things will turn out or what surprises may be revealed, and Iâ€™m loving that energy and excitement. What I do know is I will eagerly await the next book which will undoubtedly deliver another intriguing piece to Edenâ€™s and the Se7en Sinnersâ€™ story.

âž½ FULL REVIEW NOW POSTED.
My problem was expectations. I thought I would relate, I didnâ€™t. My problem was feeling. I thought I would feel, I couldn't.
JG fans please don't throw tomatoes at me. Although if you throw them with parmesan cheese or mozzarella cheese, I may, just may be okay with it.
Do I think everyone will hate this book? Hell, no.
I for sure know many people will be able to relate and enjoy this book. So donâ€™t feel discouraged to pick this up if you want to. There was nothing wrong, yet everything was wrong for me as a reader.
Do I recommend it? Yes, if you are a usual JG fan and if you are interested in reading more OCD representation.
OCD representation, yes hell yes, I am glad his book exists. Many people could relate, many had this book piercing their heart, so yes I currently think what the hell is wrong with me. I have the theory that I am a robot. So if you have a solution for me please send it my way.
Mr. Green can definitely write and he obviously is very well received by the audiences, if not how will he be a bestseller author, two movies produced based on his books already, heck they are probably even producing this one while I am writing this review. I donâ€™t think there is anything atrocious, I just canâ€™t connect and I feel very much bored while reading his stories. My only exception has been The Fault In Our Stars and his history youtube channel, he has seriously saved me some grades. But anyways letâ€™s not make this personal.
Plot?
Not consistent. It felt like a random stuff put together, finally distracting you from the actual point. I mean this would have been best if we were totally focused on the mental health aspect of the story, but suddenly this bounty hunter stuff was thrown at us, and it didnâ€™t even have a worthy climax or anything. It felt dull.
Characters?
Couldnâ€™t connect with anybody. As a teenager, I always end up with the sensation that I am reading adults (like not only in this book, but pretty much everything John Green has written), and it bothers me.
Aza: I think people who have OCD could relate a lot to her and this whole book, I just couldnâ€™t. But for that, I give 1,000 kudos, the representation a mental illness, but this just doesn't mean I loved this book. I really wanted more than just Azaâ€™s perspective because I felt I couldnâ€™t get anything from the book. Maybe this was the intention, but I basically hated it, because it felt like there was nothing going on or important to remember. She also made me realize I am really getting tired of the whole â€œpsychologist suck they are just pricks who fake listening to usâ€ because fuck I am freaking tired of all YA books not having good mental health help.
Davis: Why did he even exist? I mean I felt he was the manic pixie dream character we always found in John Greenâ€™s characters. I liked he liked poetry, thatâ€™s about it. I honestly couldnâ€™t even feel sorry for him and his dad plot. Yes, I have an ice heart.
Daisy: Mmmmmâ€¦. How can I say this? Oh yeah, I didnâ€™t like her. Again, she just was a terrible friend? As bad as Aza was to her, the fanfic part was too low my dear. Also, I havenâ€™t watch star wars I donâ€™t plan to watch it ever, and I was not the even minimum interested in her freaking Chubaka stories.
Relationship?
Why did it exist? H-O-N-E-S-T-L-Y. Please, someone, explain to me. There wasnâ€™t even palpable attraction to start with, I couldnâ€™t. I donâ€™t even have words because there is basically nothing to talk about.
Writing?
Yeah some cool quotes, but I donâ€™t emotionally connect, I felt bored.I really struggled, 258 pages felt like 1576868 pages.
To not make this review completely negative here are some quotes I will keep. Just know I still regret physically highlighting this book, I want my money back, sigh. If the books were just this quotes it would have probably been 5 stars.
â€œBut I was beginning to learn that your life is a story told.â€
â€œItâ€™s a weird phrase in English, in love, like itâ€™s a sea you drown in or a town you live in. You donâ€™t get to be anything else-in friendship or in anger or in hope. All you can be is in love.â€
â€œI wanted to tell her that I was getting better because that was supposed to be the narrative of the illness: It was a hurdle you jumped over or a battle you won. Illness is a story told in the past.â€
â€œAnd weâ€™re such language-based creatures that to some extent we cannot know what we cannot name. And so we assume it isnâ€™t real. We refer to it with catch-all terms, like crazy or chronic pain, terms that both ostracize and minimize. The term chronic pain captures nothing of the grinding, constant, ceaseless, inescapable hurt. And the term crazy arrives at us with none of the terror or worry you live with. Nor do either of those terms connote the courage people in such pains exemplify, which is why Iâ€™d ask you to frame your mental health around a word other than crazy.â€

Tell me if Beau is not the ideal book boyfriend?
We already know that Beau is Maisyâ€™s brother and used to rescue people. So when Sabrina Felicityâ€™s best friend shows up in Prescott having fled some criminals heâ€™ll make it his mission to hide her far away in the woods at the most remote outpost.
The only problem?
Sabrina is a city girl through and through.
She hates bugs, canâ€™t stand pets and has never gone camping. So her first moments at the outpost were â€¦ interesting.
But Sabrina is a strong girl and she is not about to be discouraged by roughing it up. Especially when this gorgeous hunk of a man will keep her companyâ€¦
I thought I would despise Sabrina for what she has done. Yes she was a heroine taking down a criminal ring and hiding from them but what she did to succeed, why she seemed to have done this should have made me loath her. Yet I admired and empathized with her to my utter astonishment.
Thatâ€™s Devneyâ€™s work here and Beauâ€™s intake truly.
What Sabrina did was very courageous and dangerous.
â€œI had written an incredibly condemning article vilifying a prominent Seattle family tied to the Russian mafia. Basically, Iâ€™d waltzed right into the middle of a hornetâ€™s nest and started poking the wasps. It was no surprise that Iâ€™d been stung.â€
Honestly who would dare entering the wolfâ€™s den to take it down?
Now that she was stranded in Montanaâ€™s mountains she will ponder on her past actions, her life, her goals. In this it could be a coming of age story or as my friend Shanah hates the abuse of these words rather a personal journey story.
Sabrina and Beau comes from two different worlds: the city girl and the mountain man. Yet they were perfect for each other. If only they could see it.
From the moment this book landed on my Kindle I was immersed in their story. So why not 5 stars? Because Iâ€™m being picky sometimes and to reach the next level I would have loved even more angst and suspense.
If you are looking for stories with perfect heroes, strong heroine, majestic settings, romance and some but not too much angst this is the perfect pick.
Added bonus: Devney delivers perfect epilogues (I love reading about characters months or years after) and I got to red more about her past heroes!

Doughty's last book, Smoke Gets in Your Eyes: And Other Lessons from the Crematory, was a ""pull the curtains back"" on the funerary industry piece, and I enjoyed that one immensely. This book follows a different logic altogether, instead of Doughty sharing information about her field, she is now learning right along with us as she travels to a few locations [Indonesia, Bolivia, Spain, Mexico, various locations in the US) and learns more about their rituals around death, burial practices, etc.

,"Romance, Lgbt, Lesbian, Fiction, Lesbian Fiction ",MJS,"ARC provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.
I wanted to try this because Iâ€™m trying to find new authors, but Iâ€™m not sure how to rate this one really. I usually steer clear of the â€˜married straight woman meets gay woman, figures out sheâ€™s not all that straightâ€™ books, but since the husband was already gone, I figured at least I wouldnâ€™t have to put up with that drama. I was wishing for it by the end.
The book starts out well, the way Kathryn and Pam meet and their get togethers were cute (if a bit too fast, most of them happen in the space of about a week, and could have been spaced out over a few weeks to provide a bit more realism), and the banter between them was fun. Everything was going along fine til we hit the 40% mark (does anyone else miss actual page numbers?), and then WHAM. Horrible plot line appears and just like that, most of the rest of the story becomes a train wreck.
This revolved around Pamâ€™s best friend Judy, and honestly just kept getting worse. Without giving anything away for those who prefer to be spoiler free, I also want to point out that if Judyâ€™s character was a guy who kept doing that to Pam, I doubt it would have been treated in the same way, so the double standard also annoyed me.
Both families and most of the friends were accepting, and the Thanksgiving visits were interesting, although again, too fast considering the timing of the relationship. And Kathrynâ€™s motherâ€™s turnaround at the end was too fast and not really explained well enough for me.
The last 20% was pretty much a hot mess (when even secondary characters are telling the leads this about their lives, itâ€™s probably not a good thing) and featured way too much Judy for me. So, all in all Iâ€™d give it 4 stars for the beginning, 3 stars for the middle, and 2 stars for the end. Iâ€™m rating it 2.5 but rounding up to 3 stars because itâ€™s a debut novel, and itâ€™s well written. I liked enough of it to try something else by this author, but hopefully something with a bit less soap opera to it.
For those who do want to know, major plot points are revealed in the spoiler tag.

Openly Straight is one of my all-time favourite books. No wonder I was hoping for a sequel, especially because the ending wasn't exactly what I had wished for.
Honestly Ben made my wish come true, while not fulfilling it at the same time.
The Good Stuff:
-Ben & Rafe finally end up together.
-Bill Kongisberg's sense of humour is A+ (most of the time)
-The author touches many important subjects such as sexuality and sexual identity and abuse
-It discusses (and disables) the many clichÃ©s of what it means to be a ""real man"". Because making sexist jokes, telling yourself and others to ""man up"" and thinking that being sensitive and emotional makes you less of a man is bullshit.
The Not So Good Stuff:
-The whole book was somehow less fun and not as passionate as the first one
-Toeing around the word ""sex"" and repeatedly saying ""during"" instead of ""during sex"" or ""while we had sex"". It annoys me so much that YA authors cover things up so much. I feel stupid saying this but sex is the most normal thing in the world. So why is it so hard write a simple sex scene? It doesn't have to be sexy or erotic, it doesn't have to be perfect or romantic. The problem is, in the YA genre, sex is the stuff for a subordinate clause. It is like a myth, or better, like the elephant in the room that no one likes to address. We all know what's happening but no one likes to talk about it. So listen up authors: We can and we will handle it. We know what sex is. We can handle words like vagina, penis and butt perfectly well, even when they are in the middle of a thing with each other. We are curious and we might even learn from it.
-Ben's POV was less exciting than Rafe's. He is often stuck in his head and his thought process feels staged and simplified, like a lecture. It's like the author is giving you the ""Bisexuality 101"" talk, or ""Privilege for Beginners"". A little more subtlety would have made this book seem less juvenile in many ways.
-The plot and pacing could have been improved. Even Ben's relationship to Rafe was less exciting than before. I don't really like huge melodramatic scenes but this book might have needed a pinch of that.
In a nutshell: I enjoyed this, but not as much as I wanted to. Compared to the first book this one was a bit of a disappointment and I even considered rating it two stars but I couldn't do it. It seemed way to harsh and overall Bill meant really well.

Star Trek has invaded Star Wars.
Gone are the good old days of â€œGood Guys and Bad Guysâ€ in Star Wars.
While I always find it interesting to read a book or watch a movie from the bad guys perspective (rather like reading a text book on how to improve writing my own villains and creating delusional characters who believe evil is good) another reader pointed out that there is really no one to root for in this book and that is true.
The characters, especially Del Meeko, were good. The writing style itself is exceptional and the Audible narrator is AMAZING. The story was interesting and I could have given it a three star if the author had just been willing to plant a few more flags and changed the ending.
In the beginning of the book, it was clear that the audience was supposed to know that the Imperial characters, though sincere, were wrongâ€”but by the end of it I felt like she was trying to convert me into thinking, basically, no one is good, no one is bad, we ought to be able to understand, like and tolerate Nazi type villains and terrorists that bomb school children.
And then to cap at all off - this weird mystical moment of semi-sentient robot things that dispose the myraids of bodies lying around. This apparently very significant scene was supposed to make us feel better / hopeful and instead left me staring and laughing incredulously.
To summarize: Definitely a weak installment.
Content: Thematic elementsâ€”the group spends a lot of time with terrorists and have to make a lot of â€˜hard decisionsâ€™â€”though I was pleasantly surprised at how the author cut around torture scenes. It is implied that the four MCs (two men and two women) share the same cabin (such a liberated day and age), there is a one kiss and a romance between two different species. A lot of violence and gross disposal of bodies. (less)",Negatif
,"Romance, M M Romance, Sports and Games, Sports, Contemporary",Rebecca,"Thereâ€™s definitely no such thing as a little harmless fun when it comes to a one-night stand between a man whose life is in turmoil due to outside forces and a closeted gay professional hockey player who pretends to be someone heâ€™s not because he canâ€™t risk the league or his teammates finding out his sexual orientation.
And, this idea of the difficulties involved with giving into harmless temptation is further proven when, after 14 months, Roan Gregory and Colton â€œSegâ€ Seguine canâ€™t stop thinking about one another and their passionate night all those months ago, which further complicates their lives when fate brings them together again and their need to keep each other at armâ€™s length becomes an impossibility.
Every story and couple in Nicole Edwardsâ€™ Pier 70 series has been phenomenal, but thereâ€™s just something extra special about Roan and Segâ€™s story. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s because readers have witnessed Roanâ€™s struggles since Cam and Gannonâ€™s book or if his extenuating circumstances and the heartbreak he endures adds to Roanâ€™s complexity and witnessing him give himself over to Seg helps readers to feel like Roan will be okay as long as he gets out of his own head and takes what Seg is offering despite the complications that arise due to Segâ€™s public image and Segâ€™s need to come out to the media on his own terms.
What was supposed to be a harmless connection turns into a meaningful bond that neither man wants to give up, and as long as Seg can prove to Roan that Segâ€™s not ashamed of him and wants to build on what they feel for each other despite Roanâ€™s family baggage and tendency to get lost in his own head, waiting for something good in his life to go bad, these two alphas have what it takes to conquer the obstacles they face as long as theyâ€™re willing to communicate and invest in what seems to be developing between them.
I absolutely adored Roan and Segâ€™s story. Witnessing these two controlled men giving up control to the other one was smoking hot! And, while both of them make decisions and take actions that frustrated me, based on the situations that they individually find themselves having to deal with, makes those harmful choices realistic regardless of how much damage they create.
Nicole Edwardsâ€™ Pier 70 series is full of M/M goodness, but itâ€™s so much more than that as well â€“ the bonds of friendship is a recurrent theme explored in each coupleâ€™s story and the personal and familial issues that must be dealt with allow readers to connect with the main characters and revel in the fact that this group of best friends have each otherâ€™s back at all times despite the tension or issues between them.
Lovers of M/M will want to claim every one of the Pier 70 heroes and those new to the genre or those thinking about trying it for the first time canâ€™t go wrong by picking up this series because the message of Love is Love resonates in on every page in every story, which is ultimately why romance readers choose a book!

Hmm Ok I think I wanted to like this story more than I did.
I loved Archie, you canâ€™t help but feel for him. And Clara is a likable girl donâ€™t get me wrong.
But I think waiting for her to open up just took too long.
She expected Archie to just word vomit all his secrets and feelings but she keeps her all bottled up.
And believe me I get why, it just kinda of felt like she could have opened up a lot faster than having to wait till the last chapter.
I did like the back and forth with these characters and we get to see some of our favorites from books past yaya!
Thatâ€™s always fun for me.
I just I donâ€™t know maybe I was expecting more. Over all I enjoyed the story and the characters.

New York City: 1940. Ruby Sutton is an American journalist that has just received the ""dream job"", an opportunity to work as a journalist in London and carry the stories she finds there to the British and American public. 
While in London, Ruby meets a British officer named Bennett and through him she finds for the first time the family that she never had growing up. Jennifer Robson really knows how to transport readers or in the words
 of another reviewer ""step into"" the World War II era. The atmosphere matches the fear and the ""stiff upper lip"" of the British people during the Blitz. Goodnight from London is a very human story and Ruby is the perfect 
character to be our ""eyes"" and ""ears"" to tell it.
So why is this book not a 4 or 5 star? Well, I guess it's probably that I have been reading WWII era books for a long time and I just feel that in some instances this book falls into the glossy romanticism of that period.

,"Fiction, Contemporary, Lgbt",Elyse Walters,"Happy New Year!
A gorgeous eye catching book cover....
A story with a lot of heart...
Kept me reading into the New Year early morning hours. I enjoyed this novel very much - but itâ€™s not without flaws.
The â€˜very-VERYâ€™ beginning ....â€Once Upon a Time Claude Was Bornâ€, I felt the writing was â€˜too busyâ€™- â€˜too wordyâ€™...
But then....
It got FUNNY...really hysterical: We get a glimpse of Rosie and Pennâ€™s dating life,(inspiring dating life...I was impressed), sex life, work schedules, - marriage - and how they manage their lives with 5 boys. Very moving parenting - loving open parents.....ALTHOUGH THEY MIGHT HAVE REACHED OUT FOR LEGITIMATE GUIDANCE. Plus....later in the book, I wasnâ€™t convinced a family secret that developed (withhold really), was the best choice to insert in the storytelling. All the children in the family needed some counseling. I would have liked to have seen how that dynamic might have played out.
The family live in Madison, Wisconsin- so â€˜snowâ€™ was to consider when driving to kids to preschool. Hectic mornings getting everyone out of the house. Later in the story the family moves to Seattle....a reason for the move!
Also - towards the beginning- we learned about Rosie and Pennâ€™s childhood- just enough - which might explain why they had a large family. And - no....it wasnâ€™t because they were of the mormon faith. They were Jews. Jews have no issues about birth control.
Rosie was a doctor/Pediatrician - Penn a stay at home novelist.
Pennâ€™s the family storyteller....as for those novels ... well, heâ€™s living inside his own...busy years of child raising a gender dysphoric child.
â€œClaudeâ€ was the last birth: the baby of the family. He was 3 years old when he
expressed wanting to wear a dress. He also said he didnâ€™t want to be a â€œbig boyâ€.
His immediate family was very supportive - open-minded - and tolerant of all their kids choices. Even Grandma bought him a pink bikini â€” when she told him he could pick out any swim suit he wanted for summer to wear to the public pool.
At some point Claude changes his name to Poppy. There was a clear reason for this. Rather touching- but just one of several places in the book where it seemed to me, Claude was much more mature-in-thinking than his actual developmental age.
â€œThis Is How It Isâ€, by Laurie Frankel is a great book club choice - it doesnâ€™t always move in the directions the reader thinks it might - which is great - showing sides of raising a transgender that many people have not thought about: debate about treating trans kids with puberty blockers, or hormone suppressors for one example.
A little too long...yet....itâ€™s easy to forgive because most important â€” the author took a complex subject - created a loving family with wonderful child character in Claude/Poppy.
We feelâ€™ empathy for this child.... charming & loving -
and.....
.....isnâ€™t that what every trans child want to feel in the world - loved and accepted?
Recommended....enjoy this family: Claude/Poppy,... the humor, the complexity- compassion - the love. (less)",Positif
,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Retellings, Fairy Tales",Katie,"I really wanted to love this more than I did. And it wasn't a bad book, I just didn't particularly care for it.
Lost in a Book is sort of a side story in the Beauty and the Beast story (like from the 2017 movie specifically) kind of in an AU. In this book, two sisters, Love and Death, have a wager on whether or not Belle will love the Beast and break the curse and Death decides that she isn't going to play fair, so she tries to lure Belle away by getting trapped in a book.
The more I listened, the more I realised that my issue wasn't so much with the story or the premise but the fact that it specifically is within the Beauty and the Beast story. I think I would have enjoyed this so much more if the story stayed the same but the characters were in a different setting/they were different characters. Because overall, I thought it was an interesting take. I just didn't really like the characterization of any of the characters and found that most of them seemed to be completely different than what I know from the movie.
This is clearly an issue that I had personally, and I am sure that others will love this book (it has almost a 4 star rating on GR so clearly there were people who liked it more than me!) but overall, this just wasn't for me. (less)",Netral

âž¦Ah, Winston brother and their beards... Don't you just want to...
âž¦I have so many questions. Is it soft? How would it feel? You know, in places that shall not be named...
âž¦If I actually manage to get my mind out of the gutter I might be able to produce a somewhat sensible review here. Now, what's the bear doing?
âž¦Yeah, we all know what you thought. ANYWAYS. I loved this enemies to lovers story with very peculiar characters. Beau, the hero of the book, has to work side by side with Shelly, a new female mechanic. She is closed off but when she talks she is blunt to the point of rudeness.
âž¦Naturally, being a nice do-gooder, Beau is pissed off to no end with such behavior on her part. Once he starts digging, however, he realizes that there is a reason for Shelly's rude demeanor. Will finding out the truth help him understand Shelly better and pursue a relationship with her?
âž¦I have to say that I really enjoyed the complexity of the characters - they are unique and fascinating, especially the heroine. The transition between enemies and lovers was very well done, albeit a bit too slow for my taste. But I suppose it was fitting given the situation.
âž¦Did I think some things were a bit drawn out? Sure. But I'd be lying if I didn't say that I enjoyed this book very much. There were some elements consisting of family drama and that's generally not my cuppa. But other than that this book revolved mainly around the slow build up of a relationship between two main characters. Take that plus some unexpected laugh out loud moments and you got yourself a great enemies to lovers romance with unique characters that you're unlikely to forget anytime soon!

I was so excited to read this book, to read about little Racer, that once I got my copy I had to stop everything to read it. This book doesnâ€™t disappoint. My Remy and Brookeâ€™s son is so much more than I hoped. Lets just say ""like father, like son""
Racer, a blue eyed dare devil, is one sexy man. Heâ€™s a street car racer, the best in the field. Lana is looking for the best driver to help save her family's F1 team, and she finds him in Racer. Their relationship was intense from the start. Their chemistry is palpable and you knew these two were meant for each other.
Racer has demons he needs to fight against, and he thinks heâ€™ll never find a woman who will love him entirely. Heâ€™s beautiful, sexy, hard working and confident. But deep down he has insecurities and is afraid to show weakness. Lana likes to take care of the people she loves. She is sweet, smart and loyal. They both compliment each other beautifully.
I really enjoyed the F1 scene. I grew up watching F1 with my dad and brothers, so I was excited to read a book with a F1 racer. That whole world just captivates me, the speed, the sound of the cars and yes, the sexy drivers too.
Overall this was a great book. I loved seeing Remy, Brooke and the rest of the gang, even if it was in little scenes. It was like reuniting with family again. I highly recommend you read the entire series because its amazing!

,"Romance, Contemporary Romance, Contemporary, Humor, Funny",Rebecca,"Anyone who calls herself the best friend of Brooke Barker is bound to be just as quirky and opinionated and have a brain-to-mouth filter that frequently malfunctions, and as endearing and hilarious as Carlyâ€™s verbal diarrhea may be, it also gets her into quite a bit of trouble of the frisky and mistake variety, especially when it comes to her best friendâ€™s brother, Zeke Elliott.
For the past 11 years, Carly and Zeke have tolerated each otherâ€™s existence; because theyâ€™re polar opposites and donâ€™t really get along that well, theyâ€™re more prone to give one another shit than sit down and watch a movie together and have a normal conversation.
But one night Carly gives into her sluttiness, losing her mind and indulging in a handsome and cocky jackass who now seems to be EVERYWHERE she is after their one night together that never happened, which irrevocably alters Carlyâ€™s life goals.
Emma Hart, once again, creates a highly entertaining as well as complex heroine who is crazy in all the best ways and would absolutely be a friend readers would want to have because as much of an asshole she can be, giving Brooke as much bullshit as possible, she always has Brookeâ€™s back and willingly supports her and lends her an ear every time itâ€™s needed and those qualities make Carly the best choice for a best friend.
Zeke is a bit of a wildcard because readers donâ€™t know a lot about him besides the fact that his fiancÃ©e cheated on him, leaving him with immense insecurities when it comes to relationships and forcing him to live an unattached life because he doesnâ€™t know how to trust again. But he does seem like the perfect match for Carly because the way they exchange barbs and the sexual tension that seems to constantly exist between them proves that they just might give each other what they need as long as theyâ€™re both willing to take a chance on their unexpected connection.
Emma Hartâ€™s romantic comedies are playful, crazy, and down-right addictive because she expertly crafts stories with a perfect blend of steam, romance, and hilarity. Carly is just as crazy and stubborn as Brooke, which means readers never know what will come out of her mouth or what actions sheâ€™ll take that sheâ€™ll then regret and obsess over.
Iâ€™m thoroughly enjoying Emma Hartâ€™s Barley Cross series; itâ€™s addictive because readers never know what will come out of the heroinesâ€™ mouths and the antics they find themselves participating in are never dull or normal, which only adds to the amusement of each and every read!

If you are in deep trouble but lucky, you find it is more than a rumor, that it is a small town totally off the grid in the harsh environs of the Yukon. A town originally meant for someone fleeing an abusive spouse, a stalker, someone wrongly accused or convicted of a non-violent crime. Later Rockton changes, with maybe a hit man, murderer, or a sex offender; but always someone who pays very well inserted into town and past Sheriff Eric Dalton and his small department. But eventually Dalton will find out the true crime behind the false entry crime.
Eric is a dictator, answering only to the off-site council. He has to be to keep the residents safe. If you go into the forest you are put on wood chopping detail. If you go stir crazy and run, you are hunted down and returned. It's too dangerous in the forest. There are settlers, mostly former residents or their descendants who live even more off the grid and are neither friendly nor welcoming. Then there are the hostiles. Considered to be more animal than human, no one knows what they really are. But most of all the forest itself is dangerous. Not trying to kill you, just not caring about you.
While Eric has flown south on a supply run, one of the residents makes a run for it. Detective Casey Duncan and Deputy Will Anders decide to go after him. After a blizzard hits, they take shelter in a cave where they make the nightmarish yet welcome discovery of a young woman who has spent the last year as a prisoner in a hole in the cave. This woman had been termed a runner. After an extensive search and with convincing evidence of her death turning up, the woman had been declared dead.
The remains of found of two more women missing from years ago are found and Rockton is turned upside down with fear. Tentative contacts with wary settlers, harsh weather, and an outside ruling council hinder investigations. No one can face the idea of contact with a hostile. Except for a resident who would like one ""to study"".
Once again I was sucked into this lost town although I might not want to move to Rockton as I wish to do with Louise Penny's Three Pines. Armstrong has created a world that is both compelling and unsettling. The characters, including the minor characters are fascinating, each with their own story to hide. The romance between Eric and Casey is sweet, watching two loners navigate the perils of a true relationship. This is a stellar follow up to City of the Lost.

Hill hits the ground running with Snapshot, an eerie little coming-of-age tale revolving around a supernatural Polaroid camera. I was worried at first that this would be Hill riffing again on his father, Stephen King, who wrote his own supernatural camera story way back when with The Sun Dog, but Hill gets off a good one here and does his own thing. The result is pretty fantastic, with some solid meditations on aging and the fear of our own personal futures. There's a great deal of emotional resonance to this one, and Hill pulled pretty hard on my heartstrings. Not quite a tear-jerker, but it got pretty dang close.
Loaded is unapologetically political, and frankly I don't think it would work any other way. This story tackles America's favorite obsession, our one true golden idol - guns, guns, guns! Sensitive readers who decry having politics in their fiction will be clutching their pearls in white-knuckled fists hard enough to make diamonds when they lay their eyes on this one! This here story is a ripped from the headlines of Everywhere, USA horror revolving around racism and gun violence. I have no problem with political stories, and I agree with the majority of what Hill has to say here. What bugged me, though, is that it took a really, really, really long time for this novella to start going places. At first it felt more like a series of short stories united by a common element, as Hill introduces a number of characters over the course of several chapters (one who disappears for a good long while) before showing us how it all comes together. I was a bit frustrated, initially, but once the various threads started coming together, I found this to be a pretty decent work overall, and I now find myself wanting to see Hill play around a bit more in the crime genre.
Aloft has some cool character development and relationships, and although the situation Aubrey finds himself in during a parachute jump gone awry is certainly interesting, I just wasn't able to suspend my disbelief deeply enough for this one to gel with me. Even at novella length, it seemed to carry on longer than needed, or at least longer than my interest could stay vested, and I found myself itching to get off this ride way too soon.
By the time I was about half-way through Aloft, I was ready to chalk up this book as a loss. What had started out strong was quickly devolving, and I'd gone from a really strong opening, to an OK crime story, to finally just wanting to be done with this thing. And then I hit upon Rain, the final story in this sequence, and holy crap.
Hill admits to spoofing himself and his doorstopper of a book, The Fireman, with Rain, and while I enjoyed the former title quite a lot, this one is better. It's shorter, leaner, and our central character goes places. It's nicely apocalyptic and strange, and Hill gets in a few solid pot-shots at Donald Trump (which are both highly appreciated and slightly amusing, but also too f'ing accurate...). So yeah, I dug the heck out of this one.
Although the middle portion of the book fatigued me, Strange Weather is ultimately redeemed by its strong opening and an even better finish. If either Snapshot or Rain had been released as solo stories, each would have been an easy five star for me. Taken a whole, though, this is a pretty solid three-star collection for me and I'll be happily adding my signed pre-order to the shelves alongside Hill's other works once it arrives in October.

,"Romance, Contemporary, Contemporary Romance, Fiction",â™¥â„³elody,"*sigh*
Not the gripping finale I was hoping it would be.
I still stand by the opinion that this series was not suited for a 3 part trilogy. Not even close. There was no way to resolve all the drama and story threads Ward started in the very first book and wrap everything up in a realistic and satisfying fashion 2 books later. Each character deserved their own book IMO. This book is perfect example of why.
My first and probably biggest problem: Where was the romance?
This was the initial debate when Ward first announced this series, readers were questioning if this series was full on ""romance"" or just contemporary fiction. When I started the first book I did struggle with the beginning a bit but once things kicked off I got sucked in. The characters and some of the couples really captured my interest and heart. However, that did not happen for me in The Angels' Share and unfortunately it did not happen for me here either. For a finale, this was incredibly anticlimactic.
Ward got so bogged down and focused on unnecessary specifics like the surrounding environments, world building and business politics etc., that the characters were completely drowned out. The primary players who needed the most focus disappeared and became total afterthoughts and treated like footnotes. Gin, Samuel T., Amelia, Edward, Sutton, Maxwell, Mac should have been ALL over this book. Instead I saw more of Lane, Lizzie and Lane's friend Jeff (who is a passable secondary character) than I wanted to. Why Lane and Lizzie were treated as leads through all 3 books is beyond me. ðŸ˜• I didn't understand this approach and felt it was a big mistake and missed opportunity on Ward's part. If anything all this did was just reaffirm my opinion on Lizzie King. I still don't like her. And no I still do not get WTF Lane sees in this vanilla, sniffy, emotionally-stunted, selfish, judgmental goody goody who has a stick up her butt 90% of the time.(view spoiler) But that's a rant for another time......
The couples that really needed more page time, focus and more development were treated like B characters with rushed resolutions.
My other issue: The killer's reveal. Was it shocking? Kinda. Surprising? No. And a bit too contrived to be completely honest. (view spoiler) But ok let's just go with it. For me the issue wasn't necessarily the sketchy unrealistic specifics but the overall shock factor was completely missing. And then to have Edward willing to throw his whole life away to cover for this person only to act so fucking put out & disappointed when he finds out this person confessed and he's getting freed was the extra cherry on top of this mucked-up plot. I mean......really? WTF Edward? His careless disgruntled attitude after the truth came out bothered me the most because it really seemed like he would rather stay in jail than go free and you know....be with the people he loved. This made no damn sense. His ""eh it is what it is"" dismissiveness I found completely out of character for him, it came off so ungrateful and tacky as fuck considering the situation (view spoiler).
The HEA payoffs: Not satisfying enough for me. Ward created all these great complex characters with drama that is intense and twisted that you wonder how these couples will ever get out of it. But the payoff for me wasn't really there. Did my faves get their HEA? Yes. But just barely. The emotional payoff certainly wasn't there. Everything felt hurried and rushed. In fact, everything in this book that was important and vital just seemed FTB (fade to black) or zoomed through in the last 20%.
Samuel T/Gin/Amelia: I love these two so much and I wanted great things for them. And I will say the winner for the biggest breakthrough and character growth in this series goes to Gin Baldwine. ðŸ‘ Going from a selfish, vain, destructive, spoiled, hell raiser to a humble mature woman who owns up to her mistakes was gratifying and probably the most-if not *only*- believable thing out of this entire book. As for the rest, yes I'm happy things worked out for her and Samuel T. but to wait to the very end of the book to get any kind of actual payoff is ridiculous and falls so short. I mean, after aaaaaaall that, that's it? All the drama, strife, anger, manipulation and hate that has been yo-yo'ed between these two for years and all that history only for them to come together at the end because of parental feels? Seriously? It just seemed so sloppy and superficial to me. Once again, the emotional depth and slow build up to a big payoff was missing for me. And that goes back to the lack of romance. Ward focused too much on the murder arc and Lane's mama issues with Miss Aurora for me to even care about the other couples. And what a shame.
Edward and Sutton were another example of that. I was such a diehard fan of these two from the beginning. I loved their potential. But my interest started to slowly wane and sputter off in the last book with the endless foot dragging and nothing happening. Pretty much the same thing here. (view spoiler) And let's not forget Edward's incredibly unenthusiastic reaction to getting out of prison. Gosh, I'm sure Sutton would be swooning and so flattered if she saw that no? ðŸ˜’ I just....nothing about this book made sense to me. It's like all the characters are thrown in scenes and saying the same thing over and over until a resolution pops up. The forward moment that does start to happen, happens too late and ended up being choppy. Edward's complete 180 in this was so jarring it gave me whiplash. It's like you could tell the author was rushed for time and was cutting out chunks of the story (and characters) to meet her page count or deadline. That's what it felt like. There is literally no gradual build up in any part of this story. Instead we get 3 pages worth in every chapter of describing interiors of office buildings, hospitals and the Easterly mansion as if readers would ever forget that or if it's even important. Seriously Ward I don't need to fucking know how big a parking lot is. Why I had to constantly read pages worth of passages of Lane just meandering around, walking on foot through a Hospital campus and taking mental notes of everything he sees is beyond me. WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT? Give me my damn story. Not B-roll scenery foot shuffling.
As for Maxwell, the black sheep rebellious brother, what a huge letdown. HUGE. What was the point of him? For a rushed family reunion? I wanted to dropkick him through a majority of this book with how useless, selfish and cowardly he was coming off. He didn't care for anyone so it was hard for me to connect or care for him in return. There are a lot of grey characters in this series but good POV and development is what counts. Ward completely dropped the ball on this character to the point I didn't understand the point of even bringing him into the fold? And I hate that because he did have sparks with Tanesha Nyce, but again Ward treated the relationship like a complete footnote and had them sparking way too late in the book. Like at the 90% mark. ðŸ˜© Such wasted potential.
And as for Mack? Remember him? The Master Distiller that was so charming and endearing and had a thing for his new assistant Beth? They only show up for 2 damn pages in this book. 2 pages?! I WANTED PAYOFF. I wanted the rest of their story dammit. Not off the page HEA. I'm happy they are together and in love but damn....talk about dropping the ball completely. ðŸ˜”
So yes while everyone got happy happy and (easy) resolutions at the end, I still wasn't satisfied with how Ward handled things. And what little I did enjoy was way too late in the game to effect my rating or overall enjoyment. Too little too late. ðŸ˜•
I'm sorry to say this but this series was an overall FAIL for me. The potential and launch was all there but the effort and execution was poor. (less)",Negatif

I didn't have any issues with the story, the pacing or even the fact that John was a bit of a player - I did have issues with the amount we had to hear about Edie's size. I'm all for diversity and encouraging authors to write about curvier women but to me, the whole point is defeated when their size is constantly bought up. It gets on my tits and pisses me off. I get it - she's fat/bigger/curvy/rounded - whatever, move on already, that shit is boring.
Also, I didn't particularly like Edie. That balance of confidence/not caring what people think wasn't quite right for me and had me disliking her for parts of the story. John, I did like.

She did, however, work out a deal with the church to play the piano for a fee during the services. So that she could hide the money away for later use. She didnâ€™t tell her mother. When she had enough she called her motherâ€™s sister, Sunshine, which her mother doesnâ€™t talk to, asking if she could come life with her since she applied for a teaching job. She planned her escape for the late night. But then she thought maybe she should tell her father.

When she asks questions, Nichol says she likes him a lot and so do the children they call him uncle Sam. She says heâ€™s great with children. But that he is a mechanic, that he has long hair but keeps it neat. Letâ€™s just say both Beth and Sam were not pleased to have been fixed up. But they liked their friends so they went along with it for this one meal.
When Beth seeâ€™s Sam she doesnâ€™t think heâ€™s bad looking but she knows heâ€™s not someone her mom would find acceptable. Long hair, beard, and tattoos. Not to mention that the look on his face shows that he is not even interested. After a tense dinner, both choose to not have dessert. As soon as they could they bolted, glad it was over.

Dashiel â€˜Churchâ€™ Churchill is trying to recover himself before heading to his hometown, he is the silent brooding type.
Church and Dixie work together at the bar owned by Asa and Rome, in the months that Church has been there, Dixie has really taken with him.

Church and Dixie have both been through a lot, Church has been through several tragedies (from his parents to being in the military) that make him want to run away as far as he can from the word love. While Dixie even through the hardships she faced never gave up on love. Dixieâ€™s gentle and sweet nature makes Church slowly but surely realise that not all love given ends up badly.
I really liked them together, its Jay Crownover so ofcourse the couple had abundance of chemistry and connection but more than I really liked how they were with each other. It was just gentle kind and caring love. It has opposites attract trope which worked really well here. We get to see them grown closer and get to know each other and fall deeper in love. They were honest and understanding towards each other. It was a natural progression of their relationship and while Church didnâ€™t think that a road trip and being this close to Dixie would make him open up to her, and just end up being really in love with her (which was what he had hoped to avoid).
The book has a road trip, a homecoming, suspense and a couple who didnâ€™t think they would get a happily ever after. I really adore this series, the characters are multifaceted, their personalities vivid and the secondary characters are also very interesting.

,"Fiction, Contemporary",Leah Bayer,"Sometimes I'll be really enjoying a book, and suddenly come to a part where you can see the seams coming undone. It begins to drift further and further from what I want it to be, until I wind up at a hot mess of an ending. Sadly, that happened with Perfect Little World: a book with a lot of potential that somehow manages to squander every one of its interesting premises.
I'll start with the good, because I really don't want to be massively negative about this. I gave it 3 stars, after all! And that is mostly because of how much I enjoyed the first 2/3rds or so. PLW is about the 'Infinite Family Project,' where ten families (9 sets of parents and one single mom, Izzy, our main character) raise their children communally. It sounds like a hippie commune, but it's led by a child psychologist and funded by a billionaire. So it's a really scientific commune! With a premise like that, you expect one of two things: a really annoying utopia, or a utopia-turned-dystopia narrative. Thankfully, PLW skirts the border between the two and gives us a story grounded in humanity.
It's not perfect, but it's not the wreck the reader (and the outside world in the novel) expect. Sure, there is tension and not all the parents get along. Sure, our main doctor has a host of issues from his parent's bizarre choices when raising him. Sure, the woman funding the project is really, really old. But for the most part, it presents a nuanced and mainly positive spin on the idea.
However... I had a lot of issues. Many of them I could have overlooked had the ending not been so terribly trite, rushed, and sappy. For instance, our main character Izzy is so annoying. She's perfect. Perfect grades in school (literally), she's good at everything she does, she's beautiful, she's kind. Kevin Wilson tries to balance her away from being a Mary Sue with a tragic backstory (ironically one of the trademarks of a Mary Sue) and her strange sense of aloofness. Izzy doesn't like being close to people. She comes off very holier-than-thou yet incredibly boring at the same time. But she's a decent narrator when she is not talking about herself, so the whole book is not through this ""woe is me, poor damaged but perfect girl"" lens.
I think the moment I realized I was not going to love this book was when Izzy started falling for the doctor leading the project (this is not a spoiler, it's mentioned in the prologue). I actually said ""oh god really? We're going there?"" when it happened. It's SO TRITE. Only single woman on the project, only single man, both are damaged by ~rough childhood~, of course they end up together. I though Izzy was actually going to get the ""you know what? I don't need a man"" narrative which I would have really respected. Instead it's so chick-lit-y and sappy and bleh.
The last half of the book feels very rushed. We get quite a few pre-IFP chapters with Izzy, and the intro chapters to the project itself are quite long. And after that, every year in the IFP is only one chapter, with some of them being quite short (like 20 pages short). It's so rushed! We don't get the in-depth look at either the children's development or the parental relations. A LOT of these chapters are spent on Izzy at art school (a plot that goes nowhere because she doesn't even want to be an artist, sigh).
And the ending! Oh god. It's so sappy and wrapped in a bow. I was really disappointed in it, mainly because it doesn't fit at all what we are told about the family & children. Literally makes no sense in its own universe, which is one of the worst things you can do with an ending.
I do think this book had a lot of potential. I think Wilson was too smitten with Izzy as a character, and needed to cut that cord badly. The book should have had a different narrator every year (we follow a different set of parents, for example) and should have been much longer (or the intro chapters should have been cut). Too much of this novel felt like useless fluff to the narrative, and we were left with so little meat on the bone. (less)",Netral

When I saw this book, I knew I had to read this story. I enjoyed the books that Elizabeth lived. An amazing lady with an incredible story.
I didn't want Love Story to end, and I know it won't. Many tears fell while I experienced this read, not only from the words but also in my own life. I hugged my wife and kids more because like John and Elizabeth I also had and have a love story.
Having read every Baxter book, this story felt as wells of love springing up all over again as each of the past stories were mentioned. This by far is the greatest of Karen's books. I wait with great anticipation for the next book of the Baxters. (less)",Positif

OH MY FUCKITY FUCK...!!!!
.
What a RIDE.. REVIEW TO COME SOON.. CAN'T FORM WORDS.. BUT I NEED TO SAY THREE WORDS FOR NOW -
FUCKING READ IT...
So the Story begins right after the first Book ""Amnesia"" ends, which by the way was super awesome. You'd think after the end of the first book, you might start getting to know who Amnesia is and what she went through.
But DAMN.. THIS BOOK.. It had so many more mysteries, more past stories and more revelations.. This book was a lot faster than the first one..and the author covers so much more story. I do not want to reveal anything and it is so difficult to tip toe around the plot..
Amnesia - I have loved this girl. She is such a strong character since the beginning. I love it when the female MC is tough from the start. She has suffered a lot and she still has the strength in her that Eddie falls for. Even though she doesn't remember anything from the past, she values her present life far much. Each day is valuable to her. She is not a Damsel in Distress and I Absolutely love that..
Eddie - Oh Eddie.. He was one of the sweetest male character written by Cambria Hebert. There is bot a single character by this author that I haven't fallen in love with, but Eddie was one of the most interesting character I have read by this author. He is sweet, but he has this anger boiling within him (not in a bad way). He has this welcoming personality for others, but when you are in his mind, you realize how much of it is true.. He is such a complex and important character in this book, and I loved how both the characters had equally important roles.
Plot- This Duet was one of the best Romantic Suspense that I have read this year...It is packed with super solid punches that come out of nowhere. It was gut-wrenching, emotional, full of suspense, so hott , and oh so sweet.
One of the Best Duet I have read this year..If you haven't read the first book, Pick it up and you will jump to this beauty..!!!
ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT..!!!!! (less)",Positif
,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction, War, World War II, European Literature, British Literature",Karen,"A novel that unfolds via letters and journals? Yess!! I am a sucker for this type of book so snatched it up. And what a fabulous book it was. Jennifer Ryanâ€™s â€œThe Chillburyâ€™s Ladies Choirâ€ sits right up there with my other favorites written in this style. The letters and diaries truly felt authentic.
â€œThere is a way of life here that I donâ€™t believe any war can crush, that will endure long after weâ€™re gone.â€
This story begins in an English village in the early days of World War II after the men of Chilbury have left to support the war effort and a village â€˜ladies onlyâ€™ choir is born. Chapters cover the next 6-months and alternate mostly via four distinctive female perspectives. Oh how I loved each of these characters and being privy to the more â€˜scandalousâ€™ events and domestic drama unrolling via their diaries and letters. The tone of the book is upbeat but there are plenty of sobering moments as the war disrupts and impacts their lives.
Jennifer Ryan has a wonderfully creative style of writing which celebrates the spirit and bonding of the women left behind during War. (less)",Positif

As usual, the hero is a sweetheart.
Pour ce nouveau roman YA de Jennifer L Armentrout, lâ€™auteur se consacre Ã  un thÃ¨me sÃ©rieux et grave. Jâ€™ai eu un peu peur au dÃ©but quand lâ€™histoire dÃ©bute par une intrigue digne des cours de lycÃ©e, avec ragots, garÃ§ons et compagnie. Mais Jen a su me surprendre et mâ€™Ã©mouvoir avec un twist que je nâ€™avais pas vu venir.
DÃ©sespÃ©rÃ©ment amoureuse de son voisin et meilleure ami de toujours Sebastian, Lena entame sa terminale. Ce qui devait Ãªtre sa derniÃ¨re annÃ©e avec ses amis et son ultime tentative dâ€™avoir son happy end se retrouve complÃ¨tement bousculÃ© par un drame qui remet toute son existence en cause. La culpabilitÃ©, le chagrin, les sentiments nÃ©gatifs la bouffent et impactent sa vie et ses proches. Lâ€™Ã©volution de son personnage tout au long du roman est traitÃ©e de belle maniÃ¨re par Jen, ce qui en fait le sujet principal, plus que la romance.
Mais Jen Ã©tant Jen, lâ€™amour nâ€™est pas mis de cÃ´tÃ©, et nous avons une histoire, dans le genre YA, qui est tendre et pudique, pas de scÃ¨nes hot ou de langage cru, mais Ã§a donne tout autant de papillons dans le ventre. Sebastian est comme dâ€™habitude avec Jen un book boyfriend parfait, mignon, prÃ©venant.

I scanned the blurb and saw ""billionaire CEO"" and I was on it. I wanted to read this before even knowing what it was officially about.
The Wright Brother is my first KA Linde read. I enjoyed it, but I couldn't seem to warm up to the hero Jensen Wright. While reading, I kept asking myself ""When am I gonna fall in love with you Jensen?!"" For a billionaire CEO, he was really passive IMO and annoying at times. I felt like the heroine Emery was the strong one and Jensen was the weak one, a little off balanced. When I open a book about a billionaire CEO I have super high expectations. Blame this addiction on Christian Grey, but I expect dominating, get-whatever-I-want hero...and Jensen was more on the sweeter side of the scale and I know some readers don't mind that but for me I just wanted more from my hero!
I do think this will be an enjoyable read for some. The storyline was a bit predictable but I did like the writing and I fell in love with the Wright family and Emery's best friend so I definitely want to finish the series.

,"Fiction, Contemporary, Literary Fiction",Neil,"I have not read any of Shamsieâ€™s previous novels, so this was new territory for me. Itâ€™s a good sign, I guess, that I have immediately added two other books to my â€œto readâ€ list to try some more. This book isnâ€™t perfect, but it is very, very good.
I have seen some discussions about the use Shamsie makes of Antigone, perhaps specifically Anouilhâ€™s version produced in occupied France during World War II. This influence is clear. You can map the characters in Home Fire against characters in Antigone. The final quarter of the book closely parallels much of the action in the play. But I think it is fair to say that Home Fire is â€œinspired byâ€ rather than â€œa re-telling ofâ€ Antigone. The first three-quarters of the book have the right characters in, but arenâ€™t telling the same story (perhaps the background to it?). Shamsie ditches several characters from the original completely and merges others into a single character. She swaps the ages of the two sisters at the heart of the story. So, she has played fast and loose with the idea of re-telling, but the inspiration is clear to see. However, I would also add that this book works perfectly well standalone: you can read it and enjoy it with no knowledge of Antigone and it will still be excellent.
Recently, I read Preti Tanejaâ€™s We That Are Young. That also uses a classic play (King Lear), although it is more of a straightforward re-telling. Tanejaâ€™s book is split into sections each of which is named after one of the main characters. The same is true of Shamsieâ€™s novel, but I prefer the way Shamsie has used her source material (although Tanejaâ€™s book is also extremely good).
In Home Fire, we get the story of Isma and her twin, younger siblings Aneeka and Parvaiz. Since their mother died, Isma has raised the two younger children. The story starts when Isma gets the opportunity to travel to America to resume her interrupted studies (the other children now being old enough to not need her around). Her journey to America quickly reveals some of the key themes that will develop. At the airport, she is detained for questioning purely, it seems, because she is a Muslim. Once in America, she continues to worry about her brother and sister and it soon becomes clear that something has gone seriously wrong with Parvaiz. Then Isma meets someone whose father is an influential politician back in England.
To say any more would be to risk spoilers. But we are thrown into a story of family secrets, clandestine love and tested loyalties against a backdrop of political manoeuvring and religious/racial tension. Key themes in Antigone are split loyalties between family and state, citizenship and the roles of women. All these are echoed in Home Fire and Shamsie holds a mirror up to our society and challenges us about these things.
I enjoyed the way the tension gradually builds. The first section focuses on Isma and her journey to America where she meets the man with the politician father. Itâ€™s scene setting and there isnâ€™t that much dramatic tension. But then subsequent sections turn to other people and we start to learn about the childrenâ€™s father and about the politician. Then we learn what is happening to Parvaiz and that leads us to the very dramatic finale.
I said at the start that I didnâ€™t think the book was perfect. And, for me, the main fault lies in the section focused on Parvaiz. It doesnâ€™t have the authenticity of the other sections and the sudden change of story telling to short, non-chronological sections was confusing when it didnâ€™t need to be done like that.
I have to say, though, that I really liked the ending. It took me by surprise a bit because there are several pages of other stuff at the back of the book, so I didnâ€™t realise it was the ending until I turned the page and discovered Iâ€™d run out of story. But my instant reaction was satisfaction that Shamsie chose to end it like that. Itâ€™s a twist on the ending of Antigone and I doubt a movie director would let it stand, but I thought it was a wonderful ending to the novel.
A very strong book and definitely one for my personal Man Booker shortlist. (less)",Positif
,"Christian, Fiction, Romance",Melanie Kilsby,"Karen Kingsbury is a well known author. I absolutely LOVE this cover and I really love Karen Kingsbury. She is an incredible, down to earth mom, wife and minister.
I do really like how she incorporates ""real life"" into her books. Though, I wasn't loving it in this book. Temptation is real and yes, the issues in this book happen often, but I was so confused by the integrity of John when he was young and really lost a lot of respect for him right from the beginning. At first, he says he wants to protect Elizabeth. Also, he is against her parents for wanting to protect her. Then, he completely breaks that trust with her and obviously her parents, only confirming why they protected her so much. This just made me cringe on the inside.
Of course, redemption is the beautiful element of the story, I just didn't feel like it was captured enough for me to stay engaged. It simple isn't my cup of tea, sadly.
A few times I have tried Kingsbury books and have come away thinking they are alright, good, capturing the fine line of fragility in people and the grace of God... just not a crazy great read. I feel this way again. Actually worse with this book. I didn't even bother finishing the book.
I loved the concept of it and really wanted to know more about their life, but, it really fell flat for me and I just wasn't that overall invested in the characters to keep going.
Given that her books are so famous, I would love to know what you think so I can better understand and maybe grow to appreciate her works much more:

Tom Perrotta is a master at exposing the secrets of suburbia. In his latest novel, Perrotta creates memorable characters -- all ripe for a juicy book club discussion. There's Eve Fletcher, the not young, but not old mom who just sent her only son off to college. Brendan, the entitled, POS son. Amber, the struggling feminist. Amanda, the millenial stuck in and dead-end job. And a whole other cast of multi-dimensional characters.
What makes Perotta's books so enjoyable is not just the wit and good storytelling, but the interwoven social commentary. In this novel he broaches the subjects of porn, transgender rights, texting/sexting, and relationships between young men and women on college campus. Perotta covers these in a ""no holds barred"" fashion. I was wishing I had read this as part of a group because there was so much I wanted to discuss!

,"Politics, nonfiction, history, economics, audiobook, autobiography, memoir",Bam,"""Consider this MY warning: We wonâ€™t be silent. We will speak out. And we WILL persist."" (Elizabeth Warren at the Senate confirmation hearings for Attorney General Jeff Sessions 2/8/2017.)
If we hope to save the middle class in this country, it appears we are going to have to do battle with the super-rich and corporations. Trump, who made campaign promises that sounded good to many people, now seems to be trying to push through healthcare, tax cuts and deregulation of Wall Street rules that will benefit the rich instead.
Elizabeth Warren is speaking out in her new book. If the Democrats are going to survive as a national party, they are going to have to come up with a more progressive policy that works for the people and restores the middle class, such as: single payer health care, a fair minimum wage, etc.
Chapter One: The Disappearing Middle Class
Try reading this chapter and not getting really angry at what is being done to the middle class! Unemployment figures are low, but are people able to support their families on the income they earn?
Did you realize that Walmart is the largest employer in this country? More than a million and a half workers. In 2015, Walmart made $14.69 billion in profits, yet pays such low, low wages that many of its employees have to rely on food stamps, rent assistance, Medicaid, etc. to stay out of poverty. In other words, Walmart benefits from more than $7 billion in subsidies from taxpayers for its employees. I have never thought of it in that way. Quite eye opening. So if Walmart paid their employees a decent living wage, that $7 billion could go for other needs.
And ""Walmart isn't alone. Every year, employers like retailers and fast-food outlets pay wages that are so low that the rest of America ponies up a collective $153 billion to subsidize their workers."" EVERY YEAR!
""Simply promising to 'Make America Great Again' won't do the trick. It's time to get serious about understanding what has gone wrong and working on a plan to fix it.""
Chapter Two: A Safer Economy
Warren reviews our economy from the Great Depression onwards. Trump is going back to Reagan-era ""trickle down"" economics with the deregulation of Wall Street and banks--the same institutions that caused the recession of 2008.
Chapter Three: Making--and Breaking--the Middle Class
""From 1935 to 1980, most Americans shared in the new income produced. The bottom 90% received 70% of all income growth. The top 10% received 30% of all income growth."" Of course, this was mostly white middle class males--most blacks, women and Jews were shut out of certain jobs and opportunities.
Then President Reagan and his 'trick-down economics' came along in 1980, with deregulation and tax cuts for big companies. Or 'voodoo economics,' as his vice president George H.W. Bush called it. Soon everyone realized this plan reduced government revenues and increased the national debt.
""The distribution of new income from 1980-2015: The bottom 90% receive 0% of all income growth and the top 10% receive 100% of all income growth.""
Trickle-down economics and tax cuts for the rich have made a shambles of our educational system, infrastructure, medical research, etc. ""It is time to bury the idea that tax cuts for the rich will pave the way to a bright future for everyone.""
Chapter Four: The Rich and Powerful Tighten their Grip
""Big corporations and rich individuals have more influence in Washington than everyone else because they can offer politicians the ingredient that's essential to any battle for reelection: money.""
""Political priorities are shaped by the perception of what problems need to be addressed, and money powerfully shapes perception.""
Chapter Five: The Moment of Upheaval
Shortly after the election, Warren spoke to the AFL-CIO: ""As the loyal opposition, we will fight harder, we will fight longer, and we will fight more passionately than ever for the rights of every human being in this country to be treated with respect and dignity. We will fight for economic opportunity, not just for some of our children, but for all of our children. We do not control the tools of government, but make no mistake, we know what we stand for. The sun will keep rising, and we will keep fighting--each day, every day, we will fight for the people of this country.""
This is Trump 'draining the swamp': by appointing as
--Secretary of the Treasury: Steven Mnuchin, 'the Goldman Sachs executive who made a fortune after the financial crash by buying a bank and turning it into a foreclosure machine, seizing people's homes.'
--head of the National Economic Council: Gary Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs.
(As Bill Mahler recently said, the only people he didn't hire from Goldman Sachs, is Goldman and Sachs! :)
--Secretary of State: Rex Tillerson, CEO of Exxon Mobil--a climate change denier.
--head of the Environmental Protection Agency: Scott Pruitt--another climate change denier. As attorney general of Oklahoma, he literally shut down the state's own environmental enforcement unit.
--head of the Department of Education: Betsy DeVos, who used her fortune to help undermine public schools in Michigan.
--head of the Department of Health and Human Services: Tom Price who has proposed privatizing Medicare and Medicaid and repealing the Affordable Care Act.
Not to mention Jeff Sessions as attorney general!

I've never read any John Scalzi before and I saw this on NetGalley and decided it would be a good entry into his work (free) and a good indication on whether to read some of his other stuff like Old Man's War.
As you might be able to tell from the rating, I didn't overly like this book. The plot strands were a bit thin, the characters didn't jump off the page and felt a bit formulaic. It doesn't help that my only real comparison for this is the Expanse series which has style and quality characters in spades. Only a few days have passed since I finished it and I'm already struggling to fully remember the names and details.
That being said, Scalzi is a good writer in that at times I did want to read more and find out bits about the universe(s) and what might happen. There were some interesting ideas but they didn't overly work out in the end for me. I'm sure I'll read some of his over work and not judge him on this one alone.

,"Romance, M M Romance, Contemporary",Debra,"Review originally posted at Sinfully.
The Metropolis is an apartment complex with a large population of gay men who thrive on gossip, sex and working out (if you follow Devon McCormack on Facebook, it might sound familiar). This does little to help Gary get through his breakup with his longtime cheating boyfriend Peter, who promptly moved in with his new lover at the Metropolis, so they canâ€™t help running into each other and being the hot topic of gossip.
Gary has seen the super sexy and hot Travis around and knows him by reputation, but he gets the full-on up close and personal when he wakes up with a naked, hungover Travis in his bed. They make the best of an awkward situation (spurred on by Garyâ€™s best friend) and the next time they meet Travis jumps in to save Gary from an awkward moment with his ex by claiming Gary as his own. And soon the plot is hatched; Gary will pose as Travisâ€™s boyfriend to help him with a business deal and Travis will be Garyâ€™s new, super sexy boyfriend to rub Peterâ€™s face in things. Oh how I love a good fake boyfriend story and this one worked very well for me.
Of course, as the fake relationship progresses a real one develops. Gary is insecure and canâ€™t believe someone in Travisâ€™s league would ever want him. Travis is outwardly confident, but has his own insecurities based mostly around his family drama. A friendship with benefits is wonderful, but soon other feelings creep in. Jealousy, possessiveness and a genuine affection are things Travis has always balked at and something Gary has always wanted. There wasnâ€™t a dull moment as both Travis and Gary help each other gain confidence in areas where it is sorely lacking.
ClichÃ©s abound, but I found the story fun, sweet, sexy and very entertaining. Itâ€™s not all fun and fluff as Travisâ€™s family issues come to a head. His brothers are lovely but his parents are horrible. Gary is also having some family issues of his own making and has to decide if heâ€™s finally going to completely be himself and open up to his parents.
Told in alternating points of view, the collaborative writing flowed seamlessly. There was great banter between Travis and Gary and a cast of secondary characters begging to tell their own stories. Most of them come off at first glance as shallow, sex starved men, but there is more to that lurking under the surface. I especially adored the sweet and supportive Hayden and the snarky but vulnerable Derek.
If you enjoy the fake boyfriend trope and are looking for a sweet, sexy and fun read, take a trip to the Metropolis and just enjoy.

I previously read and reviewed Ensnared by Rita Stradling and I have to say that she is quickly making her way to my list of must read authors.
Before I begin this review I want to thank Rita Stradling and her publishers for offering me a chance to review Colorless.
Here is the NetGalley Description
In Domengrad, there are rules all must live by: Fear the Gods. Worship the Magicians. Forsake the Iconoclasts.
To Annabelle Klein, the rules laid down by the Magicians are the mere ramblings of stuffy old men. As far as sheâ€™s concerned, the historic Iconoclasts, heretics who nearly destroyed the Magicians so long ago, are nothing but myth. She has much more important matters to worry about.
Heiress to a manor mortgaged down to its candlesticks and betrothed to her loathsome cousin, sixteen-year-old Annabelle doubts the gods could forsake her more.
Then Annabelle is informed of her parentsâ€™ sudden and simultaneous deaths, and all of the pigment drips out of her skin and hair, leaving her colorless. Within moments, Annabelle is invisible and forgotten by all who know her.
Living like a wraith in her own home, Annabelle discovers that to regain her color she must solve the mystery behind her parentsâ€™ murders and her strange transformation.
Meanwhile, hundreds of the Magiciansâ€™ monks, with their all-black eyes and conjoined minds, have usurped control of Annabelleâ€™s family manor. An Iconoclast is rumored to be aboutâ€”a person who they claim goes unseen, unheard, and lost to memory, yet is the greatest threat to all of Domengrad. For the first time in a hundred years, the monks plan to unleash the dire wolves of old.
Their only target: Annabelle.
Ok let's examine this a bit further. First I am going to warn you IT LEAVES YOU HANGING! LIKE DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNNN HANGING! There had better be another one! This is the one downfall to reading Ebooks..... sometimes the end sneaks up on you and it takes a second to realize IT'S OVER!!!! I really do not want to go into any further detail than what has already been gone over in the description because quite honestly it is way to easy to drop a ton of spoilers and since I want you to read it yourself that's not going to happen.
My review
Characters 4 I do think that Annabelle could do with some deeper characteristics. I know she lost all of her color but come on not all of her should be bland.
Plot - 4 Ok so the meat was there but where are my potatoes. The story line at times was a bit jumpy and edged on the cliche side of things in terms of almost every YA book ever.
Addictiveness - 4 Toward the end I thought about putting it down as it did get dull for a moment but picked right back up
All in all it's a strong 4. I really hope that as it continues the characters really come into their own and please do something about Tony. He's annoying. (less)",Netral

,"Mystery, Fiction, Thriller, Mystery Thriller, Suspense",G.H. Eckel,"Four adult women, friends since school, gather again because one of them, Kate, has issued the call for help none of the others ever wanted to hear. ""I need you."" The four have a history of playing a game of lying that has it's own rules, which are basically about lying consistently and well. But what have they lied about in the past and what is this mysterious summoning that reunites them? That is the central mystery of The Lying Game that gets played out over 400 pages.
The Good: The start of the book with the summoning is great. It's followed by the friends reuniting, ala the old friends reuniting in The Big Chill and Last Vegas. The characters are drawn as distinct from one another, the racier ones egging on the less racy. The game they've created about lying is a good conceit. And the twists and turns revealed at the end of the novel are clever.
The Less Than Good: Ruth Ware is clearly a talented writer. The Woman in Cabin 10 (minus the first 70 pages) is a terrific novel. Her writing style and character portrayals are winners again in The Lying Game. What is less than scintillating is the plot in the middle of the book. We certainly expect four people coming together to reminisce and enjoy their reuniting. But so many of the middle chapters are one-idea chapters that don't often relate to the plot. It's as if the plot takes a backseat to the women playing subtle mind games or having conversations that don't really lead anywhere. There's one chapter about whether or not the narrator should smoke a cigarette. Another chapter about whether or not to skinny dip. Obviously, there's character interaction and growing pains but the chapters, to me at least, are kind of one-off ideas of the women just spending time together as if there wasn't an emergency that brought them together. Throughout the middle, the women are haunted by an unexplained past, which is Ware's attempt to keep some dramatic tension where there really is very little; there's more character study than plot.
Toward the end of the novel, the plot picks back up and the secret is revealed as are some unexpected twists in the story. I enjoyed the beginning and end of the novel and not a lot in between. The publishing house spins this novel as a ""slow burner."" The novel is definitely a crock pot. For many, this will not be a problem. I'm too plot oriented to sit still when the plot is put on the back burner. That's just me.
I look forward to Ware's next book, in which I hope she turns up the heat and gets the plot going in a roiling boil.

,"Romance, Contemporary ",Donna ~ The Romance Cover,"The Wright Brother (Wright #1) by KA Linde
3.5 stars!!!
â€œIâ€™d thought tonight would be the start of everything newâ€¦and, now, I was left wondering if we were even going to make it to tomorrow.â€
The Wright Brother was very different from a KA Linde norm, this was a sweet, light and fluffy romance with a little angst and a dose of instalove. The trademark angst fest that normally goes hand in hand with a KA Linde read was absent and it was great to read a totally different side of this author.
â€œIt was a life-shifting kiss. One of those that came only once in a lifetime. The kind that you didnâ€™t want to mean more. You wanted it to be a list-induced kiss in the dark, but you couldnâ€™t even fool yourself. This one was everything.â€
When I started reading this book and the pieces were beginning to fall into place I had expectations of a traditional Kyla read, my mind was spinning with endless possibilities and as this book came to a close I was a little disappointed that they never came to fruition. But, for those that love an easy read, one where the heart isnâ€™t constantly racing for fear of what curve balls the author will throw next this will tick all those boxes.
Jensen Wright was adorable, a man scorned and reticent to love again and as such a man with huge trust issues. Jensen is a workaholic who has thrown himself into his familyâ€™s company to forget, the more he works, the more he doesnâ€™t think about his ex-wife.
Emery was near to completing her doctorate, something that had been losing its allure for quite a while. When Emery finds her long-time boyfriend cheating on her she decides enough is enough, quits the program and goes back home with her tail between her legs. Once home, her best friend persuades her to be her plus one at one of the Wrightâ€™s wedding. Having been burned by Landon Wright in the past Emery was reticent to go, but free booze was the kicker and so Emery puts on her big girls panties and prepares to face a family she has sworn away from for life.
Landon is now married and is well and truly under the thumb and extremely unhappy. Jensen is divorced and extremely single. Neither man recognises Emery at first, but with looks alone a spark is ignited between Jensen and Emery, would one night ever be enough?
â€œIt was deep and personal. He had touched my soul. Devoured my heart. And brought us both back to life. Jensen Wright had rewritten my world.â€
From the name and synopsis of this book I was expecting a love triangle of sorts, or at least a showdown between brothers and that didnâ€™t materialise, instead we are treated to secrets of Jensenâ€™s past which for me didnâ€™t hold as much as impact as a brother showdown would have, but none the less I did enjoy.
This was an easy read for me and I raced through it. While the proclamations of love did come a little too soon for my liking, especially from someone with Jensenâ€™s issues, I did love it none the less. I had a huge case of the warm and fuzzies by the end and was extremely happy. With so many Wright brothers I cannot wait for the next one, each one is intriguing in their own right and I cannot wait to see where KA Linde takes this series going forward.

Such pleasure to be on this journey with Alex and Carl Sagan. ðŸš€ Tons more enjoyable than I expected!
Since the story was told by Alex, an 11 year-old boy with responsibility level of at least a 13 year-old, we were limited in knowing several stuff ex: the older kid from the train (what happened to him there??) or with Terra and Steve. And we didn't delve into Seth's vow of silence early on either.
But the 'diary' format suited the audiobook perfectly. Each chapter was recorded with background sound and everything. The narrator for our lovely Alex was absolutely incredible! Such adorable voice and the emotions were spot on throughout the whole book.

,"Childrens, Fiction, Animals",Steve,"Chester, a chocolate Labrador, tells his story. He dearly wishes to find and serve HIS human, but the story opens with his failing to become a service dog in spite of training. In a fortunate turn of events, he is placed with ten year old Gus' family to assist Gus, an autistic boy. Neither Chester nor Gus and his family are too sure about it at its outset, but it sticks. The story takes place largely at Gus' home and in his special ed. classroom. The challenges of school lead to changes of placement. The difficulties of an autistic child, both for himself and for those around him, seem genuine and accurate, and Gus is fortunate in both his loving parents and his special ed. teacher, as well as a surprising friend he makes in the school cafeteria.
I do my best to review books and rarely include personal insights, but here I must break with that. I came to the book with great hopes, having had three service dogs, all lab mixes, and with the current one being a chocolate lab mix. I have first-hand knowledge of teaching special education. Given those, I thought the situations for Gus were largely accurate and the sticky moments between the obligations of the school and the rights of the parent and child rang true. I've seen service dogs do amazing things. I did struggle with the 'communication' that Chester was capable of, however. It's a lovely notion, but... Did I expect too much? Maybe. What I felt at the conclusion was that this was a pleasant story, realistic, and would be good for a young reader. (less)",Positif
,"Science Fiction, Fiction, Novella",Evelina | AvalinahsBooks,"I had heard all sorts of wonderful things about All Systems Red before I picked it up (I have a lot of Goodreads friends who know their stuff when it comes to sci-fi!

5 Reasons To Read All Systems Red
""Murderbot"" is a jailbroken security android (cyborg? Well, you know.) Basically, SecUnits (as they're called) function as remotely controlled synthetic human slaves, basically, and they don't get a say in any of what they're doing, which is mostly murdering hostiles and getting mashed in the process. Murderbot though, a name it has sarcastically given itself (and will be henceforth referred to as 'them' in this review), have jailbroken themselves and would rather just watch hours and hours of sci-fi soaps than interact with humans, who actually give them anxiety fits. Murderbot is incredibly introverted, you see. But in order to not disclose a) having a mind b) having free will c) their predilection towards sci-fi soap operas, Murderbot still has to do their job. Which is how they end up on a ship with a crew they actually don't hate, but... on a mission nobody should be on. Hint: it's a mission that is kind of hard to survive, and it's clearly rigged.
Reason #1. Murderbot Is More Human Than The Actual Humans
Murderbot comes across as an incredibly introverted personality who is empathetic like any other human being (maybe more so?), but shy of it and trying to hide it even from their own self. Seeing them turn to face the corner when talking to humans or panic while trying not to have their fave scrunch up into a mask of despair when being spoken to was incredibly amusing - and not in a mean way. Murderbot's shyness is SO relatable! You will love this character to bits. I know I did.
Reason #2. It's Like A Doctor Who Episode With David Tennant
For any Doctor Who fans, this book is like a good episode from the Tennant days â€“ a hostile planet pretending to be neutral, and things slowly get worse and worse and he crew has to figure out what is up. It's just so good! My interest didn't drop even once, while reading this. And I realized how much I miss a good Doctor Who episode from the old days. (Well... the ""newer old days""!)
I thought this was topical on the whole #FEELS topic. Ha. Topic. Topical. (Don't hit me.)
Reason #3. The Virtues
This book has incredibly good virtues and such an amazing moral atmosphere. And it's presented in such a self-deprecating manner as well (Shruti, you must read this!) Murderbot is willing to throw themselves in danger to protect the ones they care about, even though they're aware humans are not really supposed to care ""back"". It's really touching how Murderbot calls them ""my humans"". I would say Murderbot is a true sci-fi knight.
Reason #4. Murderbot's Gender Or Lack Thereof
Well, this is going to be hard to formulate. So, have you ever felt underrepresented? If you're a woman, you most likely have. Because we've got like maybe 2 heroes who jump in and save the day. Other than that, guys always do all the saving. Murderbot though? They don't really have a gender (and are often referred to as â€˜it' in the book, but I refuse - Murderbot has too much personality for that!) Anyway, despite probably looking like Terminator, Murderbot is not referred to as male - which is why I found myself imagining them more female than male by the middle of the book! I was surprised, but I figure it comes from wanting to see myself represented as able to do stuff, you know? And Murderbot I'd a character that lets you do that. It's pretty great.
Reason #5. It's Just So Funny!
So maybe this should have been the number one reason. This book will keep you laughing throughout the entire time you're reading it, I mean, when you're not having #feels. The manner it is written, and especially the manner Murderbot talks in is just priceless. I can't wait for further installments of The Murderbot diaries!
Other Books You Might Like
I wish I could recommend you more books like that! But such gems are not common. And I would be very happy if you recommended me something similar. Meanwhile, I can only think of two books that fit the style â€“ in terms of humor, at least. Redshirts has the same kind of ""I can't stop laughing"" thing going on, and also shares some moments of poignancy by the end. It's also impossible to put down. As for The Martian, some of the topics might be unrelated at all, but the main character is similar to Murderbot â€“ very resourcefull, brave and has the same vein of humor in the way he talks. It's also written in first person. I enjoyed both of these a lot!

,"Mystery, Fiction, Paranormal, Ghosts, American, Southern ",Kira,"3.5 stars
I didnâ€™t like this book nearly as much as the last two. Things are different now that Melanie and Jack are married with kids. Despite them finally being a couple, they still didnâ€™t feel like a team. They didnâ€™t work together as much as they did in the other books. Jack didnâ€™t make as many witty comments that get Melanie all flustered. He is my favorite character in the series, and I wanted more of him. Melanie is anal retentive and obsessive compulsive about certain things, but itâ€™s funny and endearing. Itâ€™s expected that there will be some drama since no one can live up to her lofty standards. But does there have to be a quasi love triangle in every book? The other man/woman never goes anywhere serious as a potential love interest, and itâ€™s obvious it wonâ€™t. Iâ€™m okay with them having problems, but I want them to be sure that they are 100% committed to each other for a whole book.
Although I love the cast of characters which made the book worth reading, this wasnâ€™t the best mystery ever. About half way through I figured out what really happened to Hasell and who Jayne really was. The clues about Jayne were numerous and obvious. There wasnâ€™t anyone else whose child she could possibly be. I wasnâ€™t thrilled with the plot, but Iâ€™m not a fan of secret baby storylines. A few other minor things were easy to figure out. It got annoying after awhile that the characters werenâ€™t figuring any of this stuff out. More things got on my nerves than normal, but I will gladly read the next book if there is one.

""How can you be this everything?""
Addison and Esben meet at college when she drops her drink and then when they're in the same class. But that's not the best time they meet. That's when Esben is doing a social experiment of strangers having to look into each other's eyes for 180 seconds...and it was flippin' amazing!
See, Esben is a bit of a social media celebrity around school and town...and his popularity is growing. A lot of it has to do with all the ""feel-good"" things he blogs/tweets/etc.
Addison is not social at all. She grew up in foster care...it wasn't especially horrible but it wasn't great either. However, she was adopted when she was sixteen by the awesome Simon. She just doesn't know how to relate to him.
And she doesn't know how to relate to Esben so she stays away. Her best friend, Steffi, who lives in California and has heard of Esben comes for a visit. She knows Addison and she just can't let her miss this chance at happiness. So what's a best friend to do? She gets her drunk, gets her dolled up, riled up and sends her on her way to Esben.
Thankfully, it all works out. Esben takes it slow with Addison especially after she opens up about some things. And once Addison's eyes open to what she could have in her life, she allows more in.
The way Jessica Park writes, you feel like you are right there helping Esben with his causes. It was really heartwarming. And I loved that Addison even came up with some on her own.
Of course, some heart break is coming and it wasn't hard to figure out. What I was shocked about was how much I cried! I just loved how people came together to help Addison out.
And of course, after the fact...it's quite obvious what Addison is going to do. I just have to say that Simon is the best ""Dad"" ever!!
That ending? Amaze-balls...even better than the first if that's even possible.

,"Fiction, Lgbt, Contemporary, Literary Fiction",Rebecca,"Kayeâ€™s impressive debut novel is a fresh take on themes of art, sex, violence and belonging. It has particular resonance in the wake of Brexit, showing the apparent lack of a cohesive English identity in spite of sometimes knee-jerk nationalism.
The novel takes place within roughly a year and is narrated by Mirka KomÃ¡rova, a 19-year-old Slovakian who left home suddenly after an argument with her parents and arrives in the English countryside to work for thirty-somethings Richard and Sophie Parker. She doesnâ€™t know what to expect from her new employers: â€œRichard and Sophie sounded like good names for good people. But they could be anything, they could be completely crazy.â€
Itâ€™s a live-in governess-type arrangement, and yet there are no children â€“ Mirka later learns that Sophie is having trouble getting pregnant. Instead Mirka drives the volatile Parkers to the pub so they can get drunk whenever they want, and also helps with their various money-making ventures: cooking and cleaning for B&B guests and the summerâ€™s wedding parties, serving as a beater for pheasant shoots, and assisting with Richardâ€™s taxidermy business. Her relationship with them remains uncertain: sheâ€™s not a servant but not quite an equal either; itâ€™s a careful friendship powered by jokes with Richard and cryptic crossword clues with Sophie.
At first Mirka seems disgusted by Sophieâ€™s shabby family home and the many animals around the place, both living and dead. Initially squeamish about skinning animal corpses, she gets used to it as taxidermy becomes her artistic expression. Taking inspiration from whimsical Victorian portraits of dead animals in costume, she makes intricate modern tableaux with names like Mice Raving, Freelance Squirrels and Rats at the Office Party. When her art catches the eye of a London agent, she starts preparing her pieces for an exhibit and is the subject of a magazine profile. The interviewer writes this about her:
Mirka is someone who understands the philosophical nature of her art. How, in our strange condition of being simultaneously within and outside the animal kingdom, we invest taxidermy with our longing for permanence.
I loved the level of detail about Mirkaâ€™s work â€“ itâ€™s rare to encounter such a precise account of handiwork in fiction, as opposed to in nonfiction like Edmund de Waalâ€™s The Hare with Amber Eyes and David Esterlyâ€™s The Lost Carving; Kaye herself is a potter, which might explain it â€“ and I appreciated the many meanings that dead animals take on in the novel. Theyâ€™re by turns food, art objects and sacrificial victims. Taxidermy is a perfect juxtaposition of physicality and the higher echelons of art, a canny way of blending death and beauty.
But of course the human residents of this community also fall into the titleâ€™s category: Many of them are what you might call â€˜beastlyâ€™, and the threat of violence is never far away given Richard and Sophieâ€™s argumentativeness. A promiscuous blonde, Sophie reminded me of Daisy in The Great Gatsby, so often described as careless: â€œYou are a dangerous person, Sophie,â€ Mirka says. â€œDonâ€™t say that. I didnâ€™t mean to hurt anything.â€ Mirka replies, â€œYou donâ€™t care about other things. Everything is a game. Everyone is a toy for you to play with.â€
The two different blurbs Iâ€™ve seen for the book both give too much away, so I will simply say that thereâ€™s an air of sexual tension and latent hostility surrounding this semi-isolated home, and itâ€™s intriguing to watch the dynamic shift between Richard, Sophie and Mirka. I felt that I never quite knew what would happen or how far Kaye would take things.
I did have a few minor misgivings, though: sometimes Mirkaâ€™s narration reads like a stilted translation into English, rather than a fluent outpouring; thereâ€™s a bit too much domestic detail and heavy-handed symbolism; and the themes of xenophobia and homophobia might have been introduced more subtly, rather than using certain characters as overt mouthpieces.
All the same, I read this with great interest and curiosity throughout. Itâ€™s a powerful look at assumptions versus reality, how we approach the Other, and the great effort it takes to change; itâ€™s easier to remain trapped in the roles weâ€™ve acquired. Iâ€™d recommend this to readers of Polly Samson, Francesca Segal and even Rachel Johnson (the satire Shire Hell). In particular, I was reminded of Shelter by Jung Yun and Little Children by Tom Perrotta: though suburban in setting, they share Kayeâ€™s preoccupations with sex and violence and the ways we try to hide our true selves beneath a faÃ§ade of conformity.
This is one of the most striking debut novels Iâ€™ve encountered in recent years; itâ€™s left me eager to see what Laura Kaye will do next.

,"Fiction, Literary Fiction",Michelle,"With American opioid drug use reaching astounding levels by 2016, government officials have vowed to provide funding to meet the challenges to fight this epidemic that has claimed so many lives. â€œThe Exact Nature of Our Wrongsâ€ (2017) is a dramatic and provocative portrayal of family life and addiction in the American heartland by Janet Peery, an award winning and bestselling short story writer and novelist. Peeryâ€™s debut â€œAlligator Dance: Storiesâ€ (1998) remains in print, this is her fourth book.
The Campbellâ€™s lived in Amicus, Kansas. The patriarch of the family, an elderly retired judge/attorney Abel Campbell was a WWII veteran that served in Saipan. With a quick and brilliant mind, he studied science and physics. He was a â€œmanâ€™s manâ€ an outdoorsman that enjoyed hunting/fishing. Abel, a perfectionist, had high exact standards for behavior and was profoundly disappointed in his baby boom generation adult children who had brought shame to their once respected family name he had worked diligently to preserve. Often, from the bench and with other connections, his family members had to be excused from legal charges and violations.
Hattie, married for over sixty years to Abel had tried to shield her children from their fatherâ€™s scathing wrath and judgment. As a daughter of pioneers, she was thoughtful and kind serving her community through church and civic duties. With all the scandals involving her adult childrenâ€™s multiple divorces, public intoxication, DUIâ€™s, drug/alcohol related embarrassing public confrontations, firearms violations, foreclosures, and family estrangement when â€œfamily problemsâ€ were brought to light-- Hattie was deeply troubled over these issues. In her late 80â€™s with a heart condition, she prayed that she would outlive her youngest son Billy, who was often unable to pay his rent or buy groceries.
The oldest daughter â€œDoroâ€ (Theodora) had relocated to the east coast, and had successfully raised two daughters as a single parent. Smart and literary minded, she loved poetry and literature, wrote Western novels under a pen-name, and had a great job working at a college in her community. Doro's siblings viewed her as a goody two shoes and know it all, so she had to watch her critical opinions of her siblings carefully. Doro returned to Kanas with greater frequency to help with her elderly parents increasing hospitalizations and health issues, and additional alarming family problems.
Jesse: the oldest son since their brother Nick had passed away. Nick's premature death was due to a genetic heart condition combined with sepsis, and not his heroin addiction. Jesse, a brooding moody man had tried to keep his alcohol consumption under control. His family didnâ€™t approve of his renting a room in his house to Patsy Gaddy, a floosy who had broken his heart numerous times.
Gideon: A menacing darkness in his character caused others to avoid him. His sister called him the â€œUni-Bomberâ€. Still, he was thoughtful and concerned about his family, and sincerely tried to help. He usually carried a flask of alcohol tucked inside his coat pocket.
ClairBell: Fiercely devoted to her parents, opinionated, obnoxious, judgmental, and very jealous of anyone who had the slightest advantage over her, real or imagined. The large amount of pills she took were prescribed by a doctor. ClairBell spent most of her days on her couch, affected by a variety of ailments; she loved bingo, blackjack, and yard sales, and never hesitated too loudly voice her thoughts and ideas.
Billy: The youngest 40-something, at one time or another, had ingested every illegal substance known to man. He was a confident happy-go-lucky flamboyant gay man, and used his charm and colorful personality to get the money he needed to buy drugs. Everyone loved him, and likely felt sorry for him because of his HIV status, his life prolonged for decades by AZT drug therapy. Billy's siblings were most anxious to get him admitted to a rehab facility.
This novel was never meant to be a pleasant feel good type story. Rather, the focus is on addictive behavior patterns: such as co-dependency, enabling, control and manipulation, scapegoating, lying and other problems that impact families with substance and alcohol related issues. The Campbellâ€™s needed to unite as a familyâ€”set aside differences, and deal constructively with themselves and each other, as this expertly developed storyline evolved and boldly moved to a realistic and unforgettable conclusion.

,"Romance, Contemporary, Contemporary Romance, War, Military Fiction",Corinaâ˜žBookTwinsReviews,"I love Mariana Zapata. She is hands down one of my all time favorite authors. Her last three books have all been amazing and 5 star reviews. I love her unique style, the slow burn, and all of her books have been devour-in-one-sitting kind of books. I think what makes her books so unique is her way of writing about real people and her characters are so easy to connect with.
Iâ€™ve known since the author announced it on FB that this book would be different. I didnâ€™t know exactly how different it would be but Iâ€™ve read pen pal books before, so I had an inkling of what was to come. In Dear Aaron, the exchange of letters and emails, and later on the messaging between Ruby and Aaron lasted almost 40% of the book. I think all of us Slow Burners know what to expect when we read a Mariana Zapata book, but still, I donâ€™t think I was quite prepared for that long of an exchange.
The letters between Ruby and Aaron were super sweet. Starting out as strangers they slowly and gradually worked their way to being friends. Throughout their conversations they got to know each other by sharing tidbits of their daily lives, family, hopes, fears and doubts. When they started messaging it became clear that they really liked each other. Their exchange, banter and jokes were wonderfully poignant and deeply touching.
Ruby was such an interesting character. Sassy but also insecure at times. Hardworking and deeply loyal to family. Her fears and worries about the future were mirrored by Aaronâ€™s trepidation about what to do when he was done with the army. He became a soldier because there was nothing that interested him right after high school. Even though he never regretted that decision neither Aaron nor Ruby had everything planned out or knew what to do with their lives. It felt unapologetically real. How many young people donâ€™t know what to do with their lives. Iâ€™ve been there once. ðŸ˜€
Iâ€™ve always loved the authors skill of waving captivating and emotional stories about regular folks. People like you and me. Nobody extraordinary, just next door kind of people.
And letâ€™s not forget the supporting characters. I adored Rubyâ€™s family. Especially her mother. She sounded like a woman to be feared but also someone that was a hoot in a crazy kind of way. It was easy to picture her thanks to Zapataâ€™s incredible skill of writing unique characters.
That being said, I really enjoyed Dear Aaron.
Was it as good as Wait For It or Wall of Winnipeg or Kulti? NO
It was sweet, but it wasnâ€™t the same fleshed out and captivating novel Iâ€™m used to. For me unfortunately, letters never work as well as regular plotted storylines. There can only be so much explained and described in letters. And whereas texting and messaging can be cute and funny, itâ€™s not the same as a regular dialogue.
I truly admire the author for writing something different. She stepped outside the molt and delivered a unique concept and plot. It just didnâ€™t work for me as well as I hoped it would.
Nevertheless, I love her style of writing and Dear Aaron was without a doubt an entertaining book that I finished in one sitting. I just wanted it to be a bit more amazing and special. But I also acknowledge that the first 40% just didn't connect with me as much as regular chapters would have. Nevertheless her writing was excellent and it's a Zapata book - so it will never be anything else than remarkable.

At the heart of this novel is a love story between two wounded and world-weary people in the winter of their lives. A traffic accident is the catalyst that sets this in motion as the two friends/colleagues help a young Guatemalan immigrant in trouble during a snow storm.
The trio's sad and often violent backstories form the bedrock of the book and in a strange sort of juxtaposition, their current story seems almost farcical as these supposedly intelligent people try to figure out a solution to the young woman's problem. I have to admit that that part of the book had me feeling jumpy with irritation and frustration.
Although I greatly admire Ms Allende's storytelling skills and have enjoyed many of her books, this one did not really work for me: their history seemed so depressing, violent and hopeless; the present, by comparison, rather silly--the plot contrived to bring the lovers together.
I wish to thank NetGalley, the author and publisher for the opportunity to read an arc of the book for my honest opinion.

What a strange but alluring book! It is a story of two boys who are friends and then they are more than that. The boys Ellis and Michael are twelve at the onset of the story discovering life, bicycling, swimming, trying to escape their fathers who are imperious, and finding that friendship leads them to something else.
The story then jumps to years later to the time when Ellis is married to Anne. In the meantime the author makes us wonder what happened to Michael. Why did these boys grown to men disconnect?
There is a beautiful connection to sunflowers particularly the reproduction of Van Gogh's work. Yellow is often the symbol of friendship, life, love and happiness and truly this book was about all of those things and yet it was much more. The flowers turn their face to the sun and while reading this book, particularly in Michael's section, I had to think that the sun was exactly what Michael was seeking. Van Gogh's tortured life the unrequited love he once felt is also reflected in Michael's life.
The only drawback to this beautifully written novel was while the author seemed to let us really get to know Michael, I felt that Ellis remained a stranger. However, this book is one of beauty, one that touches the reader with the soul of its characters, one that was short yet ever so poignant.

No, thank you very much, I do not want to start another book. I want the taste of this morsel to stay on my tongue. I donâ€™t want to blink away the dirty streets of Philadelphia in the late 1800s; I want the whole scene to stay vivid in my mindâ€™s eye. I want the feeling of Lilli de Jongâ€™s immense love for her baby, her fierce determination, to remain front and center in my heart. I want the happiness of reading this gorgeous book to stay seated in the front row of my soul. Wouldnâ€™t it be unfaithful to let myself go flitting, all la-dee-da, over to another book? I owe it to myself to hold this happiness tight, while itâ€™s nice and ripe.
I can tell when I stay all serious instead of cracking jokes that this one really got under my skin. I wasnâ€™t particularly drawn to this book before I started reading it. Iâ€™m a modern gal, and historical fiction usually doesnâ€™t do it for me. And Lilli de Jong is a Quaker, which was a drawback, because I run in the other direction when thereâ€™s a hint of religion, and I was pretty sure there would be some God stuff going on. And since it was about an unwed mother, I figured thereâ€™d be a lot of soap.
In fact, when I finished the book and was raving about it to hubby, he said, â€œSounds like a soap opera.â€ Oh my God, it most definitely is not like a soap opera. There is drama but itâ€™s real drama, not melodramatic bull. Itâ€™s a tale of survival. And Lilli is this complex, passionate woman who faces horrible choices, horrible realities.
Any sadness and desperation Lilli feels is eclipsed by her love for her baby and her single-minded determination to ensure that her baby survives. She keeps her eye on the ball. And believe me, she has to stoop to doing some horrible things. She bravely takes risks that made me cringe and squirm, and when things didnâ€™t always work out, it killed me. Yet at the same time, I completely understood why she did the things she did. Iâ€™ve never read a story about a mother with such an insanely strong attachment to her baby; she was one intense momma bear.
The writing is so good that I wasnâ€™t even aware that I was reading a book. It just swept me along, and I was right there beside Lilli. â€œOh no, donâ€™t do that, Lilli!,â€ I wanted to scream, while at the same time I was grimacing and thinking, â€œGo ahead. You must! Hurry up! You have no choice!â€ It seemed like I was feeling the same thing she was feeling. Oh man did I fret. The worry I felt was insane, my whole self was twitchy. I felt her desperation acutely, and I forgave her as she made some awful choices. What would I have done in her place? This question kept popping into my head. You canâ€™t always take the moral high road if itâ€™s a question of life and death.
I didnâ€™t know that a character like Lilli had the power to create such an emotional reaction in me. I could not have kept my distance if I tried: I felt Lilliâ€™s love toward her baby, I felt her incessant worry. I even felt the baby's moments of distress and joy. I smelled the bad city smells, I smelled peopleâ€™s sweat. I heard the horses pulling carriages, the babyâ€™s cries.
Lilli is definitely one of the most sympathetic characters Iâ€™ve ever run across. Sheâ€™s a regular person that ends up in an impossible situation, all because of the century she was born into. The fact that she hadnâ€™t done anything wrong and that she was so relatable (especially her momma-bear behavior) made it all seem more tragic. The reality of her timesâ€”the fact that an unwed mother is screwed, and that poverty and disease are so often killersâ€”is depressing and sobering. It was brutal; how lucky we are that women no longer have to live like they did. I really didnâ€™t know anything about life back then, so I was also hungrily gulping down history as I went along. (This from someone who usually doesnâ€™t have any interest in history.) I never knew, for instance, how common wet nurses were and what their lives were like.
I know this book is fiction, but the author did her research and intended the book to be true to the times. She included a lengthy note (which I highly recommend reading) saying how she researched the time period and the place (Philadelphia), as well as homes for unwed mothers, laws, and the life and language of Quakers. She really did her homework and strove to give a picture of what it would have been like for a person in Lilliâ€™s shoes. I was super impressed.
At first I thought this book would appeal only to mothers, especially those who have breastfed (there is a lot of milk!). But after finishing it, Iâ€™m thinking the appeal is much, much broader. I would love to hear what men think of itâ€”so guy friends, please give it a try!
Besides Lilli being this fabulously well-drawn character, the book has other merits: The pacing is perfect and there is lots of adventure and suspense. The story is in the form of Lilliâ€™s journal. Man, does the first-person work for me--journals always seem so cozy and honest and conversational. There is more description than I usually like, but as happens when Iâ€™m totally absorbed, I thought it was just fine, lol.
The language sounds like the language of books written in the nineteenth centuryâ€”sort of proper-sounding, and it seemed realistic. The setting and the squalor reminded me of works by Dickens, only this book was way more accessible and much less dense.
Now about the religionâ€”there is a scattering of God talk, but I mostly just flew over it. It did not get as much air time as I might have feared. And I realized that since Lilli is a Quaker, some religious stuff is to be expected. It didnâ€™t hinder my love of this book at all.
This book tore me apart. I can think of only a few other books that have had such an emotional impact on me: An Untamed State, Golden Boy, and We Need to Talk About Kevin. This book joins their ranks.
A book like this makes me realize why I love literature. To be able to be transported to another time and place, to inhabit the skin of a make-believe person, is surreal, and only a master storyteller can make this happen. I will absolutely be waiting for Bentonâ€™s next book.
I realize Iâ€™ve made this book sound sad. Well, there is a lot of sadness and many disasters, but there is also some light.
Obviously, I cannot stop thinking about this book, or talking about it, for that matter. I think this would be a great book club read. And I would jump for joy if it were made into a movie.
Non-stop intense. Non-stop edge of your seat. Un-put-down-able and highly recommended.

,"Christian Fiction, Historical, romance, Historical, Christian ",Anne,"I have long been a fan of Turanoâ€™s books and Out of the Ordinary is definitely one of the best yet! Gertrude and Harrison settled down deep in my heart. They are dear friends and have this quiet yet obvious attraction between them. Watching their ambrosial friendship develop into something more was pure delight.
Out of the Ordinary has an astonishing cast of supporting characters. Agent McParland and Edwina are two of my favorites. Surely they need a novella at the very least. :) Itâ€™s hard to read one of Turanoâ€™s stories without smiling often and letting out a few hardy chuckles. I was wholeheartedly captured by the witticism and nutty antics but you know there has to be more than just good humor to round out the plot and make it complete. It has to go deeper. And it does in several ways but the character arc that touched me the most was Mrs. Davenport, Gertrudeâ€™s employer. She is a might unconventional with a slightly shifty side but there is more to her story. I was utterly caught off guard by the turn it took near the end and thought it was one of the best moments when Mrs. Davenport is found in the church. I know that is cryptic but I donâ€™t want to give anything away. I definitely recommend this book to fans of Inspirational historical fiction.

https://reviewsofbooksonmynightstand....
This book just didn't hit the spot for me. Most of the story dragged. I didn't find it humorous and the mystery wasn't enough to keep my attention. I actually had to leave this book several times and come back to it while reading other books in order to finish it. There were some questions that I had throughout the book but the book ended without ever answering those questions, ruining any chance of any mystery with a climactic ending. The writing is strange and very choppy. I did enjoy Bellum's character and Bellum's story about her childhood and marriage made me understand why she did certain things later. Most of the characters were very interesting but I think I enjoyed their back stories more than I enjoyed the story about The Standard Grande and IRJ's reasons for wanting to buy it. This book did have some information about PTSD but I think I would have enjoyed the story more if it had focused on those aspects. Overall, I just didn't like this book. I think it would be good for someone that enjoys military banter and doesn't mind when a mystery is not solved at the end of a novel. It just wasn't my cup of tea, though.

,"Romance, New Adult, Contemporary, Young Adult, Academic, College",Gabby,"This story and these characters are very meh. It started off promising enough and I related a lot to the main character actually. She suffers from some bad depression and anxiety and is socially awkward because of it and I was relating to her a ton. But then once the love interest is introduced itâ€™s almost like her anxiety disappears because she falls in love and she keeps telling herself to be brave and her anxiety just goes away. Itâ€™s just not realistic to me that romance solves all your problems - especially with something like anxiety and feeling socially awkward (I should know lol).
This story is about these two characters who meet during a psychology study about staring a stranger in the eyes for 180 seconds. She meets Esben, who is another student at her college who also happens to be a huge viral social media celebrity and also the most optimistic, most nice person in the planet..? Esben was a little too perfect and too optimistic for my taste. Heâ€™s someone that I think I would be annoyed by in real life, but thatâ€™s just a personal me thing, not really an issue with his character but more of a personal pet peeve.

I am a huge fan of Chevy Stevens. ""Never Let You Go"" is her newest novel that will be released in March of 2017.
After reading the book description I was pretty sure that I was going to love this book.
I was right!
The book starts off from Lindsay Nash's point of view. It's November 2005. Lindsay, her husband Andrew, and daughter Sophie are on holiday in Mexico. But this is definitely not a vacation for Lindsay. She can't just enjoy the sun and relax by the pool. She wears a one-piece swimsuit, a cover-up, a hat and huge sunglasses to the beach. She averts her eyes and tries not to look at anyone, tries hard not to draw attention to herself. To others they appear to be another happy family. That's not the case. Lindsay constantly has to walk on eggshells, careful not to upset her husband and at the same time try to shield her seven-year old from what's going on. Lindsay can see the wariness that her daughter's eyes already hold, how nervous Sophie is around her father.
Something as simple as Lindsay pulling away from his kiss before HE ends it could set him off. It's a full-time job trying to keep Andrew happy. No matter how hard she tries she'll never be able to be careful enough. An accidental brush of her hand against the male server is enough to send her husband into a rage. And if he's been drinking it's even worse.
But Lindsay is one of the ones who gets away. She leaves her abusive husband and he ends up in jail. It was hard starting over but she did it. She now runs a small cleaning business, hiring women who were once in her position. And she's very focused on taking care of her teenage daughter, Sophie.
But what will happen when Andrew is released from prison? He promises that he's not going to bother them when he gets out. Will he keep that promise?
But then strange things start happening. Lindsay feels like she's being followed, and even feels like someone has been in her home. It can't be her ex-husband because he doesn't even know where they are...does he?
By taking us back to their early years together, we see how the relationship grew into the nightmare it became. Most of the time an abusive partner doesn't show their true colors right away. However, there are often those little red flags that pop up, that feeling in our gut that something isn't right.
But there's so much more to this story. Of course the toxic relationship between Lindsay and Andrew is a big part of it. But it's also about Lindsay and Sophie, and many of the other characters. The character development was excellent. I liked and admired Lindsay and I also really liked Sophie. I felt their bond was realistic and I found that I related to the close relationship they had.
Of course some of the characters behaviors and choices had me wanting to shout at my Kindle again (but I've promised my daughter I would stop doing that).
The book flows back and forth from past to present and is told from both Lindsay and Sophie's point of view. It was easy to follow along and their different perspectives on what was happening made it even more interesting. I would be positive I had it all figured out but then something would happen that had me second guessing everything I thought I knew. I was always uncertain as to what would happen next.
It was really intense and as the tension grew I knew I wasn't going to bed until I finished it. Sleep...schmeep....I needed to know how this was going to end.
It was all worth it
This was a fantastic read. Fast paced and highly suspenseful with plenty of plot twists, believable characters and situations. With a perfect amount of build-up and tension until the intense conclusion when we find out who did what and why. Honestly even if I had gotten lucky and guessed right....I would still have enjoyed the read.
I love the way Chevy Stevens tells a story. I highly recommend ""Never Let You Go"". It's a great read that gripped me from beginning to end.

,"Romance, Romance Suspense, Contemporary",Kristin,"Well, that ended... abruptly.... but I still loved it! My first Katie Ruggle book :)
Full Review:
I don't read romantic suspense very often but when I do.....
I rely on Kimberly at Caffeinated Book Reviewer for book recommendations :) She reads a ton of these types of books.
I recently read Kimberly's review for Katie Ruggle's Run to Ground and besides sounding like a great story, it was my chance to get in on a first book in a new series from Ms. Ruggle.
Set in a similar small town in Colorado as Ruggle's previous series, Search and Rescue, Theo is a complete mess, still getting over the loss of his K9 partner from a year prior and the more recent and sudden loss of his human partner and mentor on the K9 unit. Theo is so creepy and out of sorts that he is completely thrown off by the sudden appearance of a beautiful (and dare I say too innocent?) waitress at his usual diner.
Jules has just moved her brothers and sister to town to escape their own horrors and Jules wants nothing more than to stay under the radar and live a quiet, new life. Catching the attention of a police officer is the last thing she needs!
I genuinely enjoyed the dual POV of this story because Ms. Ruggle could delve into a deeper story that held a ton more emotion and depth than a typical romance. Jules' background had me intrigued - she's not quite as innocent as she seems on the outside. And I couldn't tell who's past was going to catch up to them first. This story had me guessing to the end!
Ms. Ruggle is definitely a talented, accomplished writer. There were no lulls or boring points in the story. Toss in a tear jerking service dog thread to the story and I could not put this story down. I was riveted the entire time.
I can easily recommend this series for the romance reader who wants to try romantic suspense. With a hot alpha male and the added canine companion, it is so easy to fall in love with these police officers.

Upon her arrival at the school, she draws the attention of five brother not-gods who are known for 'breaking' their servants. They start a bet over who can get her a death sentence the fastest. Luckily, Willa DOES have a brain in her body because she enters this bet and because of this, her and the brothers end up friends. Cuz, who doesn't like someone who is willing to take a death sentence on a bet? Personally, I can understand this a little. My family is willing to take jokes too far. I think that there have been plenty of times when we would have been sentenced to death for offending rooms full of people if that was a thing. I'm remembering a certain 9/11 joke I told that didn't go over too well. That was an uncomfortable Christmas.
And muttering, ""too soon?"" afterwards never seems to help..
Anyway. The brothers are awesome! They have no respect, are super hilarious, and dangerous in every way. Willa ends up becoming their little pet. And, all I could say was, ""Way to go, Willa!""

,"Horror, fiction, Fantasy, Science Fiction, Audio book ",Mindi,"I was provided a copy of Strange Weather from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.
This is a fantastic collection of 4 novellas from an author that is quickly becoming one of my favorites. Hill's writing is quirky, unflinching, and always surprising. I've found that especially with his shorter pieces, there is a fantastical element of whimsical strangeness that sometimes ends on a happy note, and other times leaves you reeling. And that's one of the things I love so much about Hill. Every story is a surprise, a concept you don't see coming, and an outcome that you can never quite predict.
The four novellas in this collection are:
Snapshot - 5 Stars
Loaded - 3 Stars
Aloft - 5 Stars
Rain - 5 Stars
Here's the deal. I'm going to try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, since the book hasn't even been released yet. Three of the stories in this collection are fantastic and exactly what I have come to expect from Hill. One of them, however, was a bit of a disappointment for me. It isn't poorly written, as a matter of fact, it's a page turner. However, and this is also a small beef that I have with Sleeping Beauties, I felt that Loaded was a little too ""riled up Hill needs to vent"" and not enough ""reader, come with me and get lost in a horror story"".
Horror is my favorite form of escape. And while Loaded is truly terrifying, in that the events of the story closely mirror the current situation in America, I feel like it was written more as a rant by Hill concerning gun control, and less a story that's meant to entertain. It's no secret that Hill and his father, Stephen King, are very politically outspoken, and that has started to deeply affect their writing. Perhaps King has always injected his politics into his fiction, and for some reason I have just never noticed it as much. Truthfully, I read most of King's novels in my teens and early 20's, and it may not have been something that I picked up on. Certainly King and Hill have become more outspoken with the current election of our new Cheeto In Chief, and while I find their acerbic comments hilarious on twitter, I'm looking for horror to escape from our current political mess, and not shove it into my face.
That being said, this is another brilliant collection from Joe Hill. I highly recommend Strange Weather, and even thought the book hasn't even been released yet, I'm already looking forward to his next release. (less)",Positif

""You defy science.""
I was really looking forward to this book with only a little trepidation that it was going to fall down the rabbit hole into the paranormal realm. And unfortunately, my intuition wasn't off...not by a long shot.
Let me explain...if I knew there was a paranormal aspect going in to the first book, I think I would have been more accepting. I really enjoy Wes and Joss and was pulling for them all the way. However, not knowing that, the story took on a kind of comic book feel. I had mentioned in my review for the first book that this reminded me of the movie, Unbreakable, and it still does.
Not that there's anything wrong with superhero books (I guess I should have taken the first line of the blurb ""literally"" to heart). It just makes things a little harder to believe.
From the ending of the last book, we know that Joss' has been in a bad place and Wes is nowhere to be found, however, both those aspects take turns for the better. Joss decides to go look for answers and while she does find some, she also finds just as many more questions.
A person from both Wes and Joss' past takes a predominant, albeit crazy, position in their lives. I was happy that both of them were able to see through some things...even if other things did indeed come true.
There's still some romance...and those were my favorite parts. Wes and Joss are still trying to figure things out and I liked how Wes started opening up to his family and friends.
There's some huge drama with Joss' dad that seemed to come out of nowhere. Again, not my favorite part and I was happy when that finally got worked out.
I did really enjoy getting to know Grace and how important she became in Joss' life. She was a welcomed addition.
I LOVED the epilogue...it was so sweet and even though I didn't like where everyone ended up, there was still hope for their futures. (less)",Positif

Send my love to your father for writing a bestselling piece of work that has been critically acclaimed by many reviewers. Your father talks a lot about being a Muslim in todayâ€™s world, how we should exhibit ourselves as a â€˜trueâ€™ Muslim who reflects the Prophetâ€™s attitude, and more importantly, how to live in a diverse world where religion can be a sensitive issue. I really wanted to like your fatherâ€™s book, but I couldnâ€™t. I read about 80% of it but I had to put it down because I feel something is missing from the very first page. There are 6.666 verses in the Quran, and not even a single verse was cited in this book your father wrote, Saif. He repeats many times in his book that the Islamic teachings are based on the Quran and the Hadith, but how is he teaching you about Islam and the values without telling you what the Quran and the Hadith really say? It seems like your father relies solely on his personal judgments and observation, and the absence of Quran verses (that are, in fact, very fundamental) makes this book less convincing to its readers. Okay, let us all create a harmonious relationship with people around us. No matter what religion, sexual orientation, or race they have, spread peace. Agree. But what do the Quran and the Hadith say about it? In which Chapter does it discuss neighborhood, for example? Thatâ€™s what your fatherâ€™s missing.

Well. That wasâ€¦dumb.â€
Their relationship was honestly so much fun to read. Claudia and Kael started out with a comical but sweet courtship where he brings her dead goats and fire breathes to cook her meals
Honestly I think I enjoyed Kaelâ€™s point of view most because it honestly had the style and thought process of a goddamn dragno
â€œHow can I make her happy?
Ah, yes.
I will feed her. That will bind her to me. She will see that I can provide for her, that I am strong and fierce.â€
He even offers to eat her enemies!!! It was the perfect balance between comedy, adventure, and honestly they are my new power couple, i love Kael so freaking much itâ€™s not even funny.
â€œTell me you are better, my mate, he demands.
Aww. So overbearing and pushy. Thatâ€™s kind of sweet, really. Overbearing, but sweet. â€œI feel like shit, but thanks for asking.â€
I want a Kael. There is literarlly a goddamn moment when he sees her all happy and amazing and says that he thinks she is more precious than life itself and like my fucking heart. He is a sexy sweetheart
Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved this book. It was a lighthearted read with some sexy shifiting and a dragon that adored a sassy girl. Sign me the hell up (less)",Positif
,"Romance, Paranormal Romance, Fantasy, Paranormal, Demons",Sophia Triad,"Cameo: Demon of Misery
Butterfly: on her lower back
Her curse: Misery, depression, tears, emotional pain. Her voise makes people commit suicides. It makes them crazy with sadness. Cameo was never happy.
Lazarus: Immortal warrior. Son of Typhon and Echidna, a Gorgon. King of the Realm of Grimm and Fantica
Supernatural ability: He is the son of the most feared immortal on Earth and a gorgon. Gorgons were a vicious race known for venomous snakes that grew from their scalps and an ability to turn anyone into stone with a simple meeting of eyes. Lazarus has a lot of things to inherit and to use. And it is not easy to kill him â€“ although he is already beheaded and dead (eh, what???)
Like Alice on her way to Wonderland, Cameo, host to the demon of Misery, tumbled end over end down a long, dark cavern.
Letâ€™s start with the basic, first facts that catch the eye:
1. The sequential number in the series. 13. For some people, it is their lucky number. For others, it brings misfortune and misery. Strong number. It suits Cameo. I have a feeling that Gena Showalter knew from the beginning of the series that book number 13 would be for Cameo.
2. The book cover. Magnificent. I loved it. I loved that Cameo is looking at the readers and dares them to hear her sad story. I loved that Lazarus is only looking at her like nothing else matters.
3. The title. The word â€˜promiseâ€™ always makes me expect strong feelings. When there is a promise, there is life. There are expectations. There is future. There is togetherness.
Cameo is Lazarusâ€™ Î¼Î¿Î½Î¿Î¼Î±Î½Î¯Î±, i.e.
in medical terms, a sick condition from which a man suffers when he is possessed by an obsessive idea or
in poetic terms the extensive desire for a woman that can bring a man to his knees
Lazarus is a man who loves his power, so he could certainly and easily kill Cameo to free himself.
Instead:
- He burns for her for years and years and she does not have a clue.
- He calls her â€œsunshineâ€.
- He keeps her in a constant state of anger in order to weaken her demon and stop her embedded sorrow.
- He craves for her smile.
- He gives her orgasms for the first time in her life.
- He wants to destroy her demon and make her happy.
- He treats her like she is His Woman.
There was no way their story would be simple.
Their background. Love? No, not really. Not any love at all for both of them.
Only many past lovers for Lazarus and a horrible mistress. Slavery is worse than death for someone who loves his power that much. Obviously he will ache for revenge.
Only a few past boyfriends for Cameo. But no love, only need. And lots of loneliness, even when she had a relationship.
Cameo is the keeper of misery and consequently her book is full of sorrow and darknesss. The story takes place at the Realms of the dead anyway.
Oh this bookâ€¦. Amazing! Showalterâ€™s writing is flawless - almost poetic.
On the whole, for me it is one of the best and strongest stories in the series. Highly anticipated and expected. It shattered my heart, blew away my mind and made me feel the strongest emotions.
No girl should be that sad, no man should be that harsh with himself. These two beings belonged together and they should never be alone again.
â€œI love you more than I can ever articulate, sunshine. You are my light on the darkest of days. To me, you are first. You will always be first. Nothing and no one will ever come before you.â€
Worth mentioning: There are a few characters that also have a small or large part in this book like Viola, the children Urban and Ever (how cute is Urban!), Hades, William, Siobhan, and the Sent Ones Angels (Thane, Bjorn and Xerxes,) with their infamous bar â€œDownfallâ€.And of course there is the story of the Pandora â€™s Box and the Morning Star which continues from the previous books.
But I think the story of Lazarus and Cameo overpowers all the side-stories.
Finally, I will like to emphasize that surely the story takes place at the darkest, gloomiest realms; nevertheless the seriesâ€™ fans will feel like they are at the seventh heaven.

,"Fantasy, Historical, Young Fiction, Paranormal",Karl,"â€œA Skinful of Shadowsâ€ by Frances Hardinge is the follow-up to her 2015 book â€œThe Lie Treeâ€. However, â€œShadowsâ€ is set just prior to the English civil war in the 1650â€™s era and utilizes as a background the gaining momentum of that war. The seventeenth century is not a common time period in which to set a YA book.
The book gives us castles, hungry soldiers, plagues, and suspicious townsfolk. Did I mention it also gives us ghosts? Oh yes, a number of ghosts. One of the great aspects of the story is that we the reader learn, grow, and gain knowledgeable life lessons along with our POV character, the young Makepeace, who learns early in the narrative she is being groomed to be the receptacle of centuries old ghosts aka souls. Like all primary characters in YA narratives, Makepeace is rebellious and strong willed, so wants a say in the proceedings.
Her first rescue, to which she becomes host, is a mistreated circus bear. Makepeace discovers just how difficult it is to trust people, a good life lesson. This becomes more and more important as she wanders through the countryside searching for safety.
A rich and endearing story â€œA Skinful of Shadowsâ€ becomes a bit episodic due to just when it seems like Makepeace has finally figured things out she must venture further on again seeking new answers to new questions.

,"Fiction, Historical, Historical Fiction",James,"3 out of 5 stars to If The Creek Don't Rise, an historical fiction novel set to be published in August 2017, written by Leah Weiss. I enjoyed reading the book, selecting 3 stars because it had several strong parts but also some concerns that I'll share later. Overall, I'm glad I read it.
Why This Book
I read the description of this book via NetGalley, where I search for all my ARCs, and thought it would be a great read prior to my upcoming trip to North Carolina, where I may be stopping in the same rural mountain area.
Plot, Characters & Setting
This is an ensemble book about a cast of 10 characters in the mid 20th century who live in the rural area of the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina. It covers a few events that occurred to some of the townspeople in Baines Creek, providing the view points from different sides of the story. It centers around Sadie Blue, a 17-year-old girl who marries the man who has just gotten her pregnant. From there, the book covers domestic abuse, murder, religion, family, love and friendships. At its core, the novel covers the various relationships built in the town, understanding who sits back doing nothing versus who takes action when they are passionate about the outcome and protection of life.
Approach & Style
I read the electronic version on my Kindle via an iPad over the course of five nights. The book is about 300 pages, each 20 pages long across 15 chapters. Each chapter is told from a different character's point of view, written in the first person perspective. Dialect is important given the book is recreating life during a historical time period in a very specific region where culture and society are quite different.
Strengths
The characters are very clear and distinct. Each of the major players has a voice you will recognize and understand. Sometimes you will love them and sometimes you will hate them, but each one will leave an impression.
The setting is quite strong. You will feel transported to this rural town in the mountains. From the description, to the dialect and to the way the story unfolds, it matches what you'd expect from the constructs of this type of environment. You will feel like you are in the town.
It deals with very specific personal and family issues that will resonate will a lot of people. From a social perspective, it highlights things that happened in the past that were almost condoned or allowed to happen, due to people's fears and lack of education or knowledge.
Concerns
When I read the description, I thought it would be a great plot and story. But when I read the book, it was quite different. This is not a novel where a primary plot point drives the chapters. It's a character-driven story that tells of the happenings in a small town. The plot isn't as important as the way each of the characters interpret it. I found myself skimming pages to get to the crux of the story, but it never happened. It's a preference style, and I think the book should be marketed differently and have an alternative description or cover summary. It would help find a different set of readers who enjoy this type of book. Had I known, I might have spent more time investing in the characters in the beginning rather than trying to piece together a plot that wasn't going to become any more clear. That said, it's still a well-written book and will appeal to a wide audience.
Author & Other Similar Books
Although they are not of the same caliber, it reminded me of the book Beartown by Fredrik Backman. Both books cover highly controversial social issues within a small town, telling the story of how everyone reacts to a few critical events. Where Beartown brings a focus on plot, this book is more about how people interpret society's values and actions.
It's the author's first book, but she shows a lot of promise. I would read another of her books, but I'd want to be careful to understand the plot and approach to telling the story to verify it matches with the way I like to read a book.
Final Thoughts
In my world, a 3 is a good review. It means you had good elements and a few things I didn't quite latch on to. If this had a little more action and some clarity around the plot and point of the book, I might have given it a 4. That said, it will definitely resonate with many readers given it has a strong pull to connect you to the characters and the setting. Hope you enjoy it.

,"Thriller, Mystery, Horror, Fiction, Mystery Thriller",emma,"first off: thanks much to Penguin First to Read for the ARC! i love that program.
i had a weird time reading this. it was unlike any thriller i've read, which at first seemed good and then turned out to definitively not be.
https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...
let's get into it. the title ""Final Girls"" is a reference to a group of 3 women who were the sole survivors of separate serial-killer massacres: Lisa, Samantha, and Quincy (our narrator). they're tabloid darlings each living separate lives (with varying degrees of normalcy) until one of them dies. ooOOH SPOOKY WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT?!?!? (unfortunately, it's nothing anywhere near as exciting as what that glorious premise deserves.)
first compliments!!! hurray.
the good:
-the main character, quincy, runs a baking blog and it's really cute - you should know by now that sweets are a passion of mine so that's exciting
-neither of my 2 guesses for what The Big Revealâ„¢ would be were exactly right (i really care about two things in a thriller: i want to have fun guessing the ending and i want my guesses to be wrong, and i want to be scared. or at least, you know, thrilled. and i guess it's good that this checked one of those boxes. the less important one, but still one of them.)
-a little bit of the last chunk was somewhat exciting. at times. (how enthusiastic does THAT sound?)
-as mentioned, the concept itself was very good (but GOD why couldn't the book live up to it)
the bad:
-nothing happens for the first 3/4 of the book. SERIOUSLY NOTHING. starting yesterday i just had to hunker down and read this in 100 page chunks. it never!! grabbed me!! and like it's a thriller so i'd like to be grabbed. (...you know what i mean)
-like i was literally checking Goodreads and Snapchat and my email and whatnot every five seconds. just bored af.
-the first 75% was also So Repetitive. i really wanna avoid spoilers, so i'll just say that the book implies two potential Big Revealsâ„¢ over. and over. and over.
-even the interactions feel repetitive
-Sam and Quincy's conversations and banter are always the saaaaaame. Jeff and Quincy have identical ""r u ok"" convos 3298472389 times.
-we hear the same spiel about Quincy's mom easily 8 times. if i have to read the phrase ""Xanax and grape soda"" one more time i'll be sent spiraling into a war flashback so intense i'll forget what reality is.
-most of the characters are BANANAS FLAT. Sam and Coop and Jeff, for sure. i have no real concept of Lisa. and it's IMPOSSIBLE to get a grip on who the hell Quincy is.
-when things start to come together (FINALLY) in the last third, it's, well...it's not great. here are some adjectives i would use to describe it: choppy, confusing, nonsensical, poorly explained, half-baked, characterizationally ill-fitting
-the climax of the book happens at about page 320 out of 345 and is over in 10 pages, SO THAT'S NOT EXACTLY A PAYOFF WORTHY OF THE 800 TIMES I READ ABOUT QUINCY LOOKING AT THE DOOR TO THE GUEST ROOM
-the last five pages really don't make sense or offer closure or fit with whatever scraps of concrete characterization Quincy had
wow. i really didn't think i had that much of a rant in me. but sweet lord i am so disappointed in this book.
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE GREAT.
bottom line: how much thrill could this ""thriller"" thrill if a thriller actually thrilled?
but seriously, this isn't a book i'd steer anyone away from. it just wasn't for me. it may be for you!!! (less)",Negatif
,"Fiction, Mystery, Contemporary",Emily May,"â€œItâ€™s difficult to live with both hope and grief.â€
I didn't really know what to expect when going into Swimming Lessons. I haven't read the author's previous work - Our Endless Numbered Days - and I couldn't decide from the synopsis whether I was going to get myself into another thriller spawned by the Gone Girl craze, or a quiet contemporary like, say, Everything I Never Told You. I can say confidently now that it's more the latter.
Swimming Lessons is a character-driven novel about a family, a love, a marriage, and how hope can be the worst thing sometimes. Here, the hope of Gil Coleman and his daughters, Nan and Flora, has haunted the family for twelve years, ever since Ingrid Coleman (Gil's wife and the girls' mother) disappeared and was never found.
Though Ingrid presumably drowned, the lack of a concrete answer plagues the family: could that woman disappearing around the corner be her? Could the phone ringing in the middle of the night be their mother finally wanting to return home?
The opening chapter sees Gil suffering an accident after seeing his long lost wife standing below his window. His daughters rush home to be with their father, but are perturbed by Gil's claims that he saw Ingrid and that she is alive. Mysterious phone calls in the middle of the night from withheld numbers make Nan and Flora even more anxious, especially when Gil claims their mother was on the phone.
It's a beautiful, quiet, sometimes eerie novel. On the one hand, it's simply a compelling story of people's lives - from Flora's perspective in the present, and through Ingrid's letters that reveal the history of her relationship with Gil - but on the other, it constantly has the reader wondering what is real. Did Gil really see Ingrid that day? Or is it the delusions of an old man keeping Ingrid alive?
The best parts of the story are Ingrid's letters. They weave a tale of a young woman who gets caught up in a love affair with her enigmatic college professor, before becoming pregnant and settling into a troubled marriage. Secrets emerge and tragedy arises, all in the author's straight-forward, non-manipulative style.
All books are created by the reader.
I really loved, perhaps most of all, the running theme of how the reader brings their own interpretations and experiences to a book. Early on, we see a young Gil collecting used books with notes in the margin, because he believes these are special little insights into the readers themselves. And then, of course, Ingrid's story and all the answers Gil, Nan and Flora seek are hidden within the books of Gil's collection. Ingrid leaves her letters - and little pieces of herself - behind in the books scattered around the house, meaning the answers were always right there, within reach.
The author leaves us with this thought-provoking message: books contain the stories of the readers, are defined and interpreted by the readers; no two readers ever read the same book, or leave the same things behind in it.

This book hit me with all the feels. I didnâ€™t want to put this book down and only did so to sleep and work. I feel raw and vulnerable after finishing this book. Fantastic storytelling.

,"Sports and Games, Sports, Romance, Contemporary Romance, Sports Romance, Hockey, Contemporary",Beverly,"Sawyer Bennettâ€™s Cold Fury series is one of my favorites. I love how each book features a different couple, but as the series has progressed so does their little family. When the series began all the players were single and seeing them paired off and building families just gives me the warm and fuzzies.
Roman is new to the story, but we quickly realize he is the team bad boy, the bruiser. In hockey itâ€™s okay to be rough and fight, but his reputation off the ice is getting to be a little much in itself. Roman and Lexi meet in the Coldy Fury offices. He is there to see Gray, the CEO, regarding his behavior and Lexi, is there to meet with the owner.
Lexiâ€™s mother recently died and on her deathbed finally told Lexi who her father was. Lexi seeking family and acceptance decides to confront her dad, Brian Brannon. Brian is the owner of the Cold Fury and his daughter Gray is the CEO. So naturally Grayâ€™s first thought is someone is after her fatherâ€™s money. I did, however, love how Brian as he never jumped to this conclusion.
See Lexi has been through so much and itâ€™s easy to sympathize with her and I quickly grew to like her. I liked how she free spirited and fun, but not reckless. I loved how well she meshed with Roman, since they both donâ€™t mind getting into trouble, but somehow seemed to ground each other.
Roman and Lexiâ€™s relationship wasnâ€™t easy, but it also felt like so much of the drama came from outside their relationship. I liked that they didnâ€™t have any major issues, but I also got frustrated with other characters. So this one is not my favorite in the series, but I did love how in this story you get two for one because we actually get to see Brian meet someone and fall in love. It was so so sweet and really made things come full circle.
I think I have said this in all my reviews, but if you love sports romances, and/or a fun sexy read dive into this series. Every book can be read as a stand alone, but I recommend them all.

I love the narrators voice and the stories are always captivating and enthralling. Some books are better than others, but all are wonderfully entertaining. And I'm always looking forward to a Lucas Davenport novel.
Golden Prey had less about Lucas's family life - which I really enjoyed, and it had less of the bullshitting that's was usually exchanged between the guys - which had me usually cracking up. So missing both of these aspects, which I enjoyed most of all, made Golden Prey one of my least favorite books in this series. Lucas a brand new marshal, experienced quite an adjustment period throughout Golden Prey. He was now a small fish in a huge pond. Being a marshal was definitely different to anything he has ever done before. And he didn't feel as comfortable and in control as he did before.
I liked the close knitted group of friends and colleges he had before, so I'm not yet sold on the marshal business, but I'll see how Lucas does on his next case. (less)",Positif
,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction, Mystery",Paromjit,"This is wonderful and compelling historical fiction by Diane Chamberlain set in the 1940s. Tess and Vincent have grown up in the same neighbourhood of Baltimore, Maryland. They are engaged, madly in love and their families are over the moon. Vincent has just qualified as a medical doctor, and Tess is in the process of becoming a registered nurse. A medical emergency in Chicago has Vincent volunteering his help, promising Tess that he will return soon. He stays away longer than expected, making Tess jittery, insecure and nervous. To distract herself, she joins her best friend Gina on a weekend away at Washington that results in tragic repercussions. On a dinner with two men, Tess gets drunk, and actions which have her getting pregnant. Tess ends her engagement with Vincent, and is surprised when well to do, furniture man, Hank Kraft, wants to marry her. Tess moves to small town Hickory, in North Carolina, a place suffering from the privations of World War 2 and simmering racial tensions.
It soon becomes apparent that Hank and Tess's marriage is in trouble, given their wedding night where Hank shows no desire for Tess, despite having made her pregnant. Trapped in a loveless marriage, and a husband with secrets, Tess has to find deep reserves to adapt to her present set of circumstances. Hickory does not welcome her, Hank's mother and sister are resentful and suspicious of her motives, and apparently another woman was meant to have married Hank, according to local women, she has stolen their marriage. Tess finds company in the domestic help, but her life feels empty and unfulfilled. When a hospital is set up for polio victims, Tess wants to do her bit. She finds her mettle as she faces down opposition to her working from Hank and his mother. Tess finds her calling as a nurse, but where is her life going to lead? What are Hank's secrets? This is a story of its time, where the past haunts the present as the truth emerges.
Diane has done impressive research of the period, capturing the culture and true life events of the time. Her details of the time, such as the illegality of marriage between the races, her deployment of a wide array of characters and her beautiful writing style gives us an atmospheric and compelling narrative located in the 1940s, with numerous twists and turns. The character of Tess captures the situations, attitudes to and expectations of women in this period of time. I really liked Tess and a number of other characters, such as Reverend Sam and the way he communes with the dead. This is a story of love, loss, race, marriage, tragedy and redemption. A wonderful piece of historical fiction that I thoroughly enjoyed reading. Just brilliant! Many thanks to PanMacmillan for an ARC. (less)",Positif

TRACKING THE TEEN DETECTIVES GENRE
The teen detectivesâ€™ genre has been quite popular, and we can remember pioneers, in the 1930s, in the field like The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew, and the genre exploded at the 1970s with the masses when Hanna-Barbera introduced Scooby-Doo franchise resulted so successful that itâ€™s still active, featuring products in almost imaginable format: traditional animation, live-action, muppets-like, LEGO CGI-animation; on TV series and movies alike; I donâ€™t think that any other animated-born franchise has been translated to so many diverse visual format like Scooby-Doo.
In fact, Hanna-Barbera was so glad with the triumph of Scooby-Doo franchise that they created many other teen detectivesâ€™ teams with similar formulas, like Clue Club, Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels, The Funky Phantom, Goober and the Ghost Chasers, The Buford Files, The New Shmoo, etcâ€¦
I watched them all when I was a kid, and I am still a huge fan of Scooby-Doo, but also I like a lot Clue Club, that I think their mysteries were more ambitious and having more suspects around to make less evident who was the culprit; and also Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels where I feel that it was a nice change in the formula since instead of being pursued by the â€œmonsterâ€, Captain Caveman was chasing the â€œmonsterâ€ when appeared.
Obviously, Scooby-Doo remained as the most popular and known franchise in the genre of teen detectivesâ€™ teams, which besides of its variety of (already mentioned) formats, a key factor for its longevity was its opening to change, in the brink of the new millenium (precisely with the direct-to-video animated film Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island (1998)), from the original stories in the 1970s & 1980s, having the â€œguy in a monsterâ€™s costumeâ€ to real paranormal menaces, that I think itâ€™s a reflection of the own peopleâ€™s opening to believe more in the paranormal phenomena, and even later of the said change, it has presented combined cases (masked criminals and paranormal stuff together).
Scooby-Doo defined the roles for teen detectivesâ€™s teams: the brave leader, the brainy girl, the pretty girl, the comedy-relief boy and of courseâ€¦
â€¦the teamâ€™s pet, quite usually, a dog.
Of course, there's should be a dog!!!
So, since the 1970s to present, the illegal activities of scheming felons and paranormal threats, have been stopped once and again, thanks to the boldness and wit of all those detective teams ofâ€¦
â€¦meddling kids!
Now this groovy genre comes back with this new novel featuring a new team of teen detectives.
RETURN TO BLYTON HILLS
Edgar Cantero, the author, crafted an ode to love for the fabulous rise in the 1970s of teen detectivesâ€™ teams where, without a doubt, Scooby-Doo, was the king franchise and where everything else came from, but that's not all...
...since he merged his own original version of Scooby-Doo-like team of detectives with the Cthulhu Mythos of H.P. Lovecraft!
So, either because of Scooby-Doo and/or the Cthulhu Mythos, definitely this is an ideal reading!
Cantero created his own teen detectivesâ€™ team (which is a wise option to avoid having to ask permission to use copyrighted characters) and with that creativity freedom, he let to his teen detective kids what you never watched beforeâ€¦
â€¦they grew up.
Of course, some Scooby-Doo material has presented the team on its young adult 20s version, and even the already mentioned Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island movie, showed them after the team disbandedâ€¦
â€¦but here, they not only disbanded, but they fell from grace.
Imagine: Hanna-Barbera's Scooby-Doo meets Stephen Kingâ€™s It, where the kids after dealing with a threat on their childhood, they have to come back to the fearsome town since the threat is still thereâ€¦
â€¦waiting for them.
The Blyton Summer Detective Club was a teen detective team made by: Peter, the brave leader; Kerri, the brainy & pretty girl; Andrea (but she prefers Andy), the tomboy girl; Nate, the comedy-relief boy; and of courseâ€¦
â€¦Sean, the dog (a Weimaraner, to be precise).
In the 1970s, during several summers, once and again, the daring Blyton Summer Detective Club, got together for unmasking many scheming felonsâ€¦
â€¦since always was a guy in a mask. Always, butâ€¦
â€¦in their last case, in 1977, they caught alright their last guy in a monsterâ€™s costume, but unexplained things happened that night, in that dreadful haunted house, and after thatâ€¦
â€¦the Blyton Summer Detective Club was no more.
Something happened that night, and it wasnâ€™t only just a guy in a monsterâ€™s costume, it was something NOT natural.
The meddling kids left the town with real fear inside of their hearts.
Blyton Hills lost its young champions.
Thirteen years later, in 1990, the team remained disbanded and they havenâ€™t spoken much with each other and their lives are in a terrible downfallâ€¦
â€¦Kerri, the brainy & pretty girl, never finished her college career in biology and having alcoholic troubles; Andy, the tomboy girl, couldnâ€™t finish her military training, and even having doing jail time (for not mentioning that she broke out of jail before ending her sentence); Nate, the comedy-relief boy, became clinically insane and even is actual resident in a psychiatric asylum; and Peter, the brave leader,â€¦
â€¦committed suicide.
The sweet campiness of their ghost-chasing cases of youth is overâ€¦
â€¦and now the fear is very real and deadly!
The scars of that last case, in 1977, are still tearing them apart, piece by piece.
For one of them is already too late, but before the rest would fell in the same fateâ€¦
â€¦the Blyton Summer Detective Club needs to be reunited again to solve (really solve) that fearsome last case.
Andy, Kerri, Nate and now Tim (Weimaraner grandson of the original Sean) have to go back to Blyton Hills, butâ€¦
â€¦each of them have secrets, and some of those secrets can change them forever. Friendships will be tested. Trust will be challenged.
They know that something strange is at Blyton Hills, but they will have to expand their own horizons if they would have any chance to solve the caseâ€¦
â€¦since masks have evolved too. (less)",Positif

Of all the books I had on my wishlist for the second half of 2017, The Burning Girl was the one I regarded with the greatest amount of trepidation. As much as Messud's The Woman Upstairs got under my skin, the plot of this one â€“ two teen girls, a small town, the eruption of adolescence, a friendship lost â€“ didn't exactly bode well. After disliking or abandoning a clutch of them, I've been making efforts to avoid these 'girls gone wild' novels; they've become a bit of a trend, perhaps not as ubiquitous as the Gone and Train type of Girls but equally profuse and patchy. When I read Beryl Bainbridge's 1972 novel Harriet Said... at the beginning of the year, I was reminded (yes, I am quoting myself here, sorry) 'how few adult authors are capable of capturing the nuances of girlhood, and how exhilarating it is when someone gets it right'.
Messud tells her characters' story in flashback, but Julia Robinson isn't an adult â€“ she's seventeen years old, about to decide which college she wants to go to, just a couple of years removed from the events she describes. This makes her raw anguish, the way she is still picking over the bones of her lost friendship with mercurial Cassie Burnes, all too real. At the same time, it strips the story of any cheap nostalgic power. These girls' youth is one of Katy Perry songs and YouTube tutorials; the most retro detail is Cassie being the only person in her family to own a smartphone. Presumably, there's a tendency for authors to frame these girlhood tales within an older character's perspective to avoid them being interpreted as stories for teenagers. There's no danger of that here â€“ the quality of Messud's writing and the depth of her character-building tells you all you need to know.
There is no preamble, no exposition. We're straight into Julia's point of view, a vivid account of her friendship with Cassie during that coming-of-age period between the beginning and middle of their teens, a time in which the girls go from playing make-believe games in an abandoned house (and what an extraordinarily evocative scene that is!) to growing apart amid the trappings of nascent adulthood: boys, parties and intricate social politics. While Julia and Cassie's relationship takes centre stage, this is just as much a story about mothers and daughters. Julia comes from a liberal yet deeply caring family, and is close to her mother, a journalist. Cassie's relationship with her nurse mom Bev is more complicated: a tight bond, but also an unhealthily codependent one. When Bev begins dating a God-fearing doctor named Anders Shute, Cassie withdraws, becomes depressed and erratic. At the same time, the story of Cassie's late father â€“ which she has embellished until it has reached the status of personal legend â€“ seems to unravel.
It's part and parcel of being a teenager that inconsequential things seem huge while events that may be life-changing barely register, at least not immediately. Messud knows this, and she depicts it with the dexterity of a true master. This book is full of darkness and foreboding but it glimmers with the impermanence of youth â€“ perhaps the most terrifying element of the story is that it is not over, yet this is the exact same thing that offers the most hope. The Burning Girl possesses an irresistible momentum, delightful and sickening at the same time, that kept me glued to it â€“ just one more page, and another, and another, until I'd burned (ha) through it before I knew it. It is just glorious.
I received an advance review copy of The Burning Girl from the publisher through Edelweiss.

,"Science Fiction, Fiction, European Literature, Czech Literature",Michael Cayley,"On the face of it, this is a tale of a Czech astronaut, Jakub, sent on a mission in the near future to investigate a dust cloud that has settled between Earth and Venus. There are flashbacks to his troubled childhood and youth as the son of someone who worked for the secret police of the former communist regime, and to the marriage he has left behind. On the mission he encounters a strange extra-terrestrial.
But this is a subtle multi-layered novel. It is also an account of emotional loss; of a nation putting its recent past behind it and lured into a world of consumerism; of how far we are trapped by our pasts and what it means to be free.
I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

,"Fantasy, Paranormal, Urban Fantasy, Romance, Paranormal Romance, Mystery",Jennifer,"I listened to Eleventh Grave in Moonlight in one sitting!
Charley usually has a few â€œirons in the fireâ€ and she really juggled few more issues this time around. There were a few mysteries, some she was paid to figure out since sheâ€™s a P.I. and all. (One canâ€™t live off of just coffee, although I think if someone could it would be Charley and Cookie.) The other mysteries were a little more personal, which is the case with all the books in Darynda Jonesâ€™ Charley Davidson series but theyâ€™ve never crossed over Charleyâ€™s job as much as the case of the Frosts aka the elderly couple that kidnapped baby Reyes all those years ago just to give him to the master, Earl Walker.
About 80% of the plot of these books are focused on the case(s) that Charley and Cookie are working on with the other 20% being part of the overall series arching plot line about Charley, Reyes and the fate of the world as we know it. I would say Eleventh Grave is more 90/10 but that ending will be a big jumping off point for The Trouble with Twelfth Grave (October 31st, 2017). Do not read the synopsis for The Trouble with Twelfth Grave BEFORE finishing Eleventh Grave in Moonlight.
I feel like Jones is leading us to the end of the series by spoon-feeding us salsa verde, only to hold mocha frappes over our heads and making us jump for them. I cannot wait to see what is in store for Charley and Reyes next.
Lorelei King delivers another stellar performance. She proves again, why the Charley Davidson series is an audio only series for me. She delivers Jonesâ€™s one-liners and snarky humor to perfection like no else could. If you have not listened to this series you really should even if youâ€™ve already read it. DO. IT. ON. AUDIO!

People are not mirrors - they donâ€™t see you how you see yourself.
a careful, careful tiptoe review for a book whose hook is how twisty its twists, how shocking its conclusion.
the publisher-letter slipped into this ARC says:
It has an ending that completely messes with your head in the very best sense - and if you can see it coming, youâ€™re smarter than everyone I know!
which is the best way to sell a book to me.
iâ€™m positive that iâ€™m not smarter than anyone anyone knows, but i read a lot, and pursuing that english degree in my youth both diminished my chances of amassing great material wealth and also ruined me for many of these â€œtwists for daysâ€ books. youâ€™re trained to close-read, youâ€™re gonna close-read. and unlike a lot of readers, iâ€™d rather be surprised than validated. i get angry if i figure things out too soon - you had one job, writer! fool me!
but this book did not make me angry. i figured out joâ€™s deal pretty early on, but nearly everything else was a delightful surprise.
as far as plotting goes, itâ€™s pretty tight. it cheats a little, but you were warned by the title and the opening bit that there would be some misdirection coming your way:
My name is Amber Reynolds. There are three things you should know about me:
1. Iâ€™m in a coma.
2. My husband doesnâ€™t love me anymore.
3. Sometimes I lie.
the story alternates between three different points in amberâ€™s life: now/then/before. or more precisely, in coma/leading up to coma/childhood journal, and itâ€™s full of messy relationships, tangled secrets, plots, lies, and much shade.
itâ€™s a fun ride full of toxic people with plenty to chew on. and the promises of
youâ€™re a twist! and youâ€™re a twist! and youâ€™re a twist! are no lie.
at the end of it all i have a couple of blurry areas - some timeline turbulence, some questions about edward and some miscellaneous loose ends, but for the most part it was fun smooth sailing. i read it in one day (or one night, since my night job has made me a daysleeper), in a mad dash to get ALL THE ANSWERS!, and if ever there was a one-sitting book, it's this one. call in sick and be cozy. you have four months to work on your fake cough.

Blind Spot was absolutely phenomenal! I loved every single minute I spent among its pages! I already knew Declan and Tanner from the two previous books of course, but it was so awesome to finally get inside their heads as well as getting their love story, and I've just gotta say I totally did not see Tanner's backstory coming at all, I loved that though because it gave such insight into her heart and who she is as a character! I loved getting to know Declan better, he was such an awesome hero and I was very glad that for once he managed to get through a whole book without a hospital stay! LOL! But seriously, I was really starting to think maybe it would be best if he was put on desk duty (at least for a while) since he couldn't seem to manage not getting himself seriously hurt! :)
The suspense was crazy good, each new development bringing me ever closer to the edge of my seat! I loved that Blind Spot continues a plot thread from the previous book, though the cliffhanger ending left me on pins and needles waiting for the next book! Dani Pettrey's tag line is Up All Night Suspense and I can't think of a better way to describe her books, they are guaranteed to keep you up all night reading!
Blind Spot blew me away with its amazingness, I hated to see it end and I cannot wait for the next book, I so hope we get to see this group of characters (all of whom have become dear friends to me) catch the person who murdered Griffin's sister Jenna!
I highly recommend Blind Spot! If you enjoy Christian romantic suspense books you need to read Dani Pettrey!

My Review:
Lane Roanoke is sent to live with her grandparents in Kansas after her mother commits suicide. She is fifteen years old with no other family members to care for her. Lane has no prior connections with her grandparents because her mother left her home as pregnant teen. The move also gives her a chance to meet with her extended family.
Lane quickly assimilates to living with her grandparents and cousin Allegra at their rural estate. Allegra is the same age as Lane and has always lived with them. Allegra explains the dysfunctional family tree and a strong bond is formed. She becomes comfortable living with her new family although her cousinâ€™s behavior is erratic. Lane eventually stumbles upon a horrific family secret that forces her to flee to California.
This novel introduces dark and difficult themes but the author weaves it into an intriguing story. The characters are all flawed individuals but they are interesting and integral to the story. I enjoyed the mixture of emotions and suspense.

,"Romance, Young Adult, Sports, Contemporary, New Adult",EscapeNBooks,"A Boy Like You by Author Ginger Scott is a young adult romance novel. It is part one of the two part series, Like You.
""Wesâ€¦heâ€™s the kind of guy you deserve. And maybe I just love you enough to want you to have it all.""
Every story has a hook moment that either works for a reader, making them crave more, or may be the reason for them to close the book and trying something different. Author Ginger Scott gave a from-the-start hook that caught me like an unsuspecting fish and WOULD NOT LET ME GO! The account of two young kids, the impact they each had on one another, and the difference that it made in their lives.
""Weâ€™re two kids who found each other when each needed someone to believe in them the most. Our bodies have grown. Our hearts are still the same.""
Wes and Joss's story was one of second chances, rebuilding and repairing, and heroes that came in all ages and sizes. I loved how this author made the characters exposed and vulnerable, but allowed them to stay somewhat hidden to create an air of emotional conflict There were so many times that my heart ached for Joss. Her pain was tangible and pushed her into situations and circumstances that compounded her grief. Wes was an absolute dreamboat. Kindess, love, and tenderness were trademark qualities that emanated from him and made him a special young man in Joss's life. These characters forced me to feel and there was no escaping it. I laughed with them and cried with them. I felt their pain, sorrow, and hope.
""I will always fight for you. I canâ€™t say no when it comes to you. I canâ€™t not fight for you. I canâ€™t not do everything in my power to keep you safe.""
The storyline itself was unique and added a totally unexpected element of mystery. I was caught in the constant flow of incidences and situations that were predictors of love and life. The added component of baseball, which I have seen happens to be one of this author's favorite sports, was authentically represented and was not used as a side to the main theme, but greatly contributed to it.
â€œYou donâ€™t belong in a box. Thatâ€™s what makes you so amazing. Youâ€¦youâ€™re a little bit of everything. And youâ€™re not ashamed to show any of it.""
I give this book a universe of stars. It was a compelling young love story, beautifully written with easy to attach to characters, an intriguing plot, and an ending that made me come unhinged. I LOVED this book and am DYING to get to the next part. A Boy Like You is a definite favorite of this year.

,"Horror, Fiction, Science Fiction, Zombies, Dystopia, Apocalyptic, Post Apocalyptic",Althea Ann,"I saw there was a new MR Carey book coming out and requested it from my library without reading anything at all about it. So I was delighted to find out when it arrived that it's a direct companion to ""The Girl With All The Gifts.""
In this post-apocalyptic future, humans are losing ground against the ""Hungries."" Fortified pockets of uninfected humans are falling to the zombie plague. In a last-ditch, desperate effort to find a cure - or any strand of hope to cling to - a mission has been sent out: an armored vehicle, containing the best remaining scientists, and a contingent of muscle to guard and protect the brains.
However, as so often happens in this kind of scenario, humans can be their own worst enemies, even in the face of a dire external threat.
Back at home base, politics and plots may be the downfall of the only safe haven they have to return to. And even aboard the ""Rosie"" (the armored tank/mobile lab) the mission is split into two groups that fail to respect each others' strengths.
One of the bones of contention is Stephen Greaves - the 'boy' of the title. He's part of the mission at Dr. Samrina Khan's insistence. As the only epidemiologist they've got, her wishes have got some weight behind them. But no one else really believes that Stephen is a genius who invented the beta-blocker lotion that allows them to 'hide' from the Hungries. From his behavior, he comes across as closer to retarded than to brilliant. As readers, privileged to be given insight into Stephen's perspective, we realize that a scientific breakthrough by the boy is probably humanity's only hope. But will his teammates recognize his value before it's too late?
While I really liked the book, I also thought that Stephen - the main character - was unfortunately the story's main weakness. It's really, really hard to pull off an ""autistic genius"" character, and rather than feeling like an accurate glimpse into the mind of a brilliant but neuroatypical individual, it ended up kind of feeling like Stephen was ""magic"" - more of a pending deus-ex-machina than a real person.
That said, the book is wonderfully written, with plenty of tension, thought-provoking content, a good mix of cynicism and hope - and some great surprises along the way.
Fans of 'The Girl Will All the Gifts' may enjoy the parallels between the two stories. (less)",Positif

,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Mystery, Science Fiction, Fiction, Did Not Finish",Krys,"I think it's safe to say that we have all been awaiting a new book by Kristin Cashore. I was delighted to see that there is a new one on the horizon for fall of this year. The book, titled Jane, Unlimited, has very little description to recommend it. That said, it's become one of the most sought after books of 2017 on pure hype alone. I understand very well, because I, myself, both read and adored Cashore's previous trilogy, including Graceling, Fire, and Bitterblue. I have been looking forward to something by her since I read an arc of Bitterblue back in 2012.
A few weeks ago, a very plain, very unadorned advanced copy of the book showed up at my work place. I took it home immediately and began to read it almost as fast. Two nights ago, I finished the book, and I have been trying to frame my thoughts around it ever since.
It starts with an ordinary girl named Jane; a young woman newly aggrieved by the death of her beloved Aunt Magnolia; an animal photographer attempting to save the oceans by raising awareness. Jane is eighteen and does not know what to do with her life after the tragedy. She makes umbrellas for fun and has kissed both a boy and a girl. She has dropped out of college, unmoored and directionless by the death of her aunt.
When a friend, Kiran Thrash, invites Jane to her home, Jane reluctantly agrees. Tu Reviens is not an ordinary place. It is a sprawling estate, luxurious, foreboding, and not without its own secrets. Upon arrival, Jane meets a host of characters who reside there; some family, some caretakers, and some who just happen to be about. You have Ravi, Kiran's twin brother, their father Octavian, who is reeling from the recent absence of his wife, Charlotte, who left him. There is Kiran's partner, Colin, and Ravi's partner, Lucy, a woman who solves art thefts. There is Patrick who works for them and his sister Ivy, who fascinates Jane. There are the Okadas, Philip and Phoebe. Then there are the mythical Panzavecchias, who everyone mentions frequently, though in absentia.
Everything is going well until suddenly two famous pieces of art go missing. That is when this novel kicks into gear, and when we discover what is really at stake in Tu Reviens.
Jane, Unlimited is, at its core, a mystery novel, a whodunit in a very classic way. However, it is also a Science Fiction novel, a Contemporary Fiction, a Spy Thriller, a philosophic Coming-of-Age story, and a bit of a Romance tale packed into one book. There are six distinct parts to the book and, surprisingly, you get six different types of book within. Ultimately though, it begins with a quandary - who stole a Vermeer painting and a Brancusi fish sculpture? Where it diverges from the formula into other genres is in the unraveling of the case itself. Instead of giving us a traditional linear format, Cashore works out-of-sequence and solves the mystery for us up front. She then provides detailed information in a series of revealing sequences that fill out the story afterwards. As such, she sometimes repeats information that disorients the reader, making them feels as if they have lived this life before, been there and done that. However, every time she does this she also adds a new element that feeds into the overarching plot and takes the book in a totally new direction both in structure and in feeling. It takes some getting used to. In fact, it took me half the book before I really had an inkling that this was what she was doing - that she was playing tricks on me, repeating herself, Groundhog Day-ing me.
This method of revelation defies tradition. Instead of happening upon clues and building up the case, Cashore works by subtraction, giving us scenes ahead of schedule that never feel forced. Typically, I myself am not the biggest mystery fan, as I find it very easy to solve things as the details are collected. In this case, my attention was kept because I didn't have that formula to rely upon any longer. She kept changing things about and reinventing how the info was presented. This simple twist allowed me to wander through this mystery naturally, to come to terms with it and put the pieces together in a very different way. It broke the mold for me in a way that I, granted in my very limited mystery reading experience, had never seen before. I don't know that this has been attempted previously, but the fact that I have not seen it yet made it new and fresh. I couldn't stop reading, and I have not been in that head space for some time - that I had to keep reading to find out what was happening.
There is, of course, a reason for everything. There is a catch to Tu Reviens that makes it special, that makes this novel special, and magical, and transcendent, but I can't tell you why it is. If the cat is let out of the bag, it ruins the entire novel. Believe me when I tell you to avoid all spoilers possible and just immerse yourself in this book. It's a very odd book, one that requires devotion, but it's very worth it. You will feel like it's not what you want it to be, and yet it's an immensely satisfying book.
But, and here is a fair warning, it's extremely character driven, and you have to make it through the first hundred pages to get anywhere. I anticipate that this may frustrate some readers.
Lest you feel like I have not said enough, here are a few images from the novel to whet your interest - a room of opened umbrellas, a night's chase in a bay, scrabble words with high points, a painting that you can reach through, two kidnapped children, a young man with graying temples, Winnie-the-Pooh, underwater photography, an ongoing Beetles play list, a lovable basset hound and his strayhound counterpart, an Edith Wharton novel, lovers on the outs, a gunshot wound, Unlimited vs. Limited, elaborate art ruses and heists, a fateful ride in a dumb-waiter, mafioso connections, the reason little black dresses were invented, UD17, sea bears...I could go on and on and on.
Jane, Unlimited is not your average novel. It's defiant in that it won't meet any of your expectations, so it's best to remove any before you open the book. It's a lovely novel about the power of space and time, and the many layers that occur between close-knit family and the friends they keep. It is a multi-dimensional thrill ride with unique and varied worlds to explore. And, when it comes down to it, it's about a young woman name Jane - grief-stricken, rudderless, and barely coping - and seeing if she makes a successful go of it. It's unique, unlike any book I have ever read, and I won't forget it any time soon.

,"Short Stories, Fiction, Feminism, Contemporary, Adult, Adult Fiction, Womens, Literary Fiction, Abandoned, Did Not Finish",Taryn,"Twenty-one short stories about flawed, complex individuals who might typically be reduced to dismissive categories. I can't say I enjoyed reading Difficult Women, but I'm glad I read it. One of the many things that Gay excelled at was creating fully-formed characters and relationships in just a few pages. I felt like I intimately knew each character, even though some of the stories were very short. We're introduced to a variety of women: jaded women, women who don't think they deserve love, women who have been hurt by those they trusted or strangers, women who want to feel pain, women who are trying to find their place, women who know exactly what they want out of life, fierce women who instinctively protect their loved ones.
It isn't light reading. These characters have been pushed to the limit and each story felt like an additional weight on my shoulders. In multiple stories a character begs another not to break their heart, only to be later disappointed. Common threads weave throughout many of the stories: child loss, adultery, abuse, rough sex, twins, the bond between women. My only complaint is that if you read it straight through, it feels like you're repeatedly reading about the same situations. I got the most out of it when I only read a single story at a time, so that I could focus more on their differences than their similarities.
One of the best parts of this collection were the moments of recognition and vindication--the feeling that someone else out there understands. There's a part in Difficult Women (Crazy Women) where a woman explains the considerations she makes when walking home late at night and her boyfriend tells her she is crazy. I had this exact same conversation in college and I remember how it made me question my own sanity. It goes to show the importance of having a diversity of voices.
I didn't feel like I fully understood every story, but I found this great quote from Gay about the creation of Water, All Its Weight: ""When I wrote this story I was living in an apartment with a rotting ceiling, and I thought: â€œWhat if someone created rot just by existing?â€ Itâ€™s interesting that a lot of people read way more into this story. When I write, there is rarely some grand statement I am trying to make. This story was simply a story about a girl who is followed, haunted by water and its weight. Literally."" (Chicago Review of Books). It made me feel more at ease when thinking about the stories that ventured into magical realism.
THE STORIES
I usually only feature my favorite short stories in these collections, but I felt the need to think through all these stories. My favorites are bolded. Many were shorter, character pieces, but I tend to like longer stories with more plot.
I Will Follow You- A haunting story about the unbreakable bond between sisters. Savvie and Carolina endured a terrible trauma together when they were children. Carolina is married now, but the sisters will always remain inseparable. A perfect opening!
Water, All Its Weight - Everywhere Bianca goes, the water follows--and then comes the rot and mold. Unable to handle the side effects of Bianca's company, everyone in her life abandons her. My favorite moment is the short time when Bianca's affliction is celebrated.
The Mark of Cain (link goes to story)- When this husband is with his mistress, he has his twin brother take his place at home. He thinks his wife doesn't know, but she does--and she prefers the brother. The cycle of violence and the burdens our family can place on us.
Difficult Women - Different categories of misunderstood women: Loose Women, Frigid Women, Crazy Woman, Mothers, Dead Girls. My favorite was Crazy Women.
Florida - A peek into the windows of a Naples, Florida community. There are racial and class divides amongst the inhabitants and employees. New resident Marcy feels out of place next to her perfect neighbors and immediately sees that they ""only [exist] in relation to those around them.""
La Negra Blanca - A stripper becomes the fixation of a wealthy client who feels entitled to her body. This man fetishizes black women, but was always taught to keep his distance so as not to ""tarnish"" the family name.
Baby Arm - A woman who knows exactly what she wants out of a relationship meets a man who gets her idiosyncracies. She conflates love and pain. She regularly attends all-girl fight club with her best friend Tate and other ""girls who keep their ugly beneath the skin where it belongs, even though sometimes, it's hard to keep it all in."" She loves Tate fiercely and Tate always knows exactly what she needs.
North Country - Kate is a black woman, which makes her a ""double novelty"" at her new university job. She's welcomed with a barrage of insensitive questions and unwanted advances. Sheâ€™s not ready for love after the end of a bad relationship and the loss of a child, but she begins to see a possible future with a charming logger named Magnus.
How - After years of being taken advantage of, Hanna's family finally pushes her to her breaking point. She makes a plan to run off with her twin sister and her true love Laura. I loved the structure this story and the mini-chapters with names like How These Things Come to Pass & How Hanna Ikonen Knows It Is Time to Get the Girl and Get Out of Town.
Requiem for a Glass Heart - A couple that loves each other, but they each need more than the other can give. The stone thrower, a man of flesh and blood, steals away moments where he ""does not have to see too much or love too carefully.â€ Likewise, the glass woman is sometimes frustrated with her husband ""who sees too much and loves too carefully."" Their needs overlap, but they're unable to provide those things for each other.
In the Event of My Fatherâ€™s Death - A father takes his daughter to his mistressâ€™s house on weekends. She eventually follows in father's footsteps.
Break All the Way Down - A woman â€œuses one hurt to cover anotherâ€ by finding an abusive boyfriend after the death of her child. Her husband stands on the sidelines until he's unable to watch her self-destruct any longer.
Bad Priest - A priest who ""lied so extravagantly that even though he was not a believer, he feared for his mortal soul.â€ He begins an affair with Rebekah, a woman who ""thrived on hopeless relationships."" My favorite part was the explanation of why Mickey became a priest.
Open Marriage - A woman toys with her husband after he suggests an open marriage. She knows he'll never be able to follow through.
A Pat - A woman extends kindness to a stranger, but her motivations may be more selfish than it initially appears.
Best Features - Milly is overweight and gets involved in unhealthy relationships because she thinks she has no choice. ""She knows how difficult it is to change the world. She used to try to change the world, but she learned better.""
Bone Density - A complicated relationship. The couple in this story both have partners outside the marriage, but they still have a strange pull towards one another.
I Am Knife - A powerful woman who uses her capability for violence to protect her loved ones. After the tragic death of her own child, she enviously watches as her twin sister's pregnant belly grows. As painful as it is, she will always be at her sister's side. â€œI wish I could carve the anger out of my body the way I cut everything else.â€
Strange Gods - The first story and last story complement each other. A woman details her past trauma and explains to her devoted partner why she sometimes pushes him away.
My favorite two stories were the ones that felt most of out place:
The Sacrifice of Darkness- Every time miner Hiram Hightower goes underground, he comes back up less of a man. Fed up with a life filled with darkness, he causes the sun to disappear by flying an air machine into it. His family is left to deal with the consequences of his actions. A sweet love story with a hopeful end.
Parents hated Joshua because their parents hated Joshuaâ€™s father and none of those kids knew how to be any better than the people who brought them into the world.
Noble Things - Takes place after the second secession of South and the New Civil War. Anna married Patrick, son of a celebrated general who led the Southern states into battle. She wants to move to the North where they've already sent their young son. Patrick hates what the South has become, but his obligation to his family makes it difficult for him to leave. Sacrifice and the ties that bind us. There are so many chilling lines in this one.
Anna and Parker had the conversations they could only have with each other. They tried to remember the before, when they were children and there was only one place to call home, one country, the flag billowing on windy days in front of homes up and down every streetâ€”bands of red and white, fifty stars, one nation, indivisible until it wasnâ€™t, how quickly it all came apart.
Difficult Women is a fascinating collection of short stories that I would love to read again eventually. There's so much to unpack that it's impossible to get it all in one go. This was my first Roxane Gay experience, but it certainly won't be my last!

,"Mystery, Fiction, Thriller, Contemporary, Mystery Thriller",Lindsay - Traveling Sister,"5 stars......my oh my!
I am kind of upset with myself......how can I be rating such a dark and disturbing story so highly? The only way I can explain and justify enjoying this book as much as I did is that this tragic story sucked me right in on page one and didn't let me up for a breath of air until the final page. Wow - I simply devoured this book!
From the moment I laid my eyes on the beautiful cover of this book when picking it up at the library, I was addicted to it - I couldn't let it leave my side. I have to admit it feels strange and wrong to have enjoyed this book as much as I did - it feels terrible even thinking about the stomach-churning storyline. Yet, while I was reading, I was fully immersed in the characters' lives and emotions, engulfed in this family's sick circumstances. I'm not going to get into any plot detail because I don't want to risk any spoilers but mainly because I don't even know how to properly explain this awful family situation.
The author, Amy Engel, blew my mind with her ability to draw me so deeply into this disturbing story. This is Engel's first novel for adults, and I certainly hope it won't be her last (although maybe next time a ""happier"" storyline????) (less)",Positif

2. I had a warm and fuzzy feeling reading this book, diving back into this world. I missed them and couldn't wait to see how everyone was doing.
3. Yes, this is a part of Teller's story - sneaky Ms. Lake made it a duet - but it's really about everyone, the club, the family. As always.
Teller has been through a lot. I'm not saying the others haven't but Ms. Lake really did a number on him. I'm hoping that you know what I'm talking about, the accident he had and the internal and external wounds and scars he got because of it.
Unfortunately, Teller blamed himself for it. So he shut off, simply switched off. The only one he was kind to was Alexa.
But he gets a blast from the past and the leading lady - who shall remain unnamed - is the one to slowly pull him out of his funk. We see a different side of his, we see his relationships with the other characters - especially Murphy - get better.
Good news is, the cliffhanger isn't a bad one, yet it still makes you curious about some things, there are questions waiting to be answered in part two and I can't wait to read it.
I really liked it, I had one hangup only but that's just me and my hangup, I'm sure others won't have anything against it.
Since it's the nth book that I read by this author, I don't think it's necessary for me to mention that I love her style, the dynamic between all the characters, how the main ones don't get out-shined by the secondary ones, even though they are well-developed. There's an awesome balance to it all.

If Grip was angsty and intense, Still is emotional and heartbreaking.
I should have known going into this book based on the person who recommended it to me *ahem* CHRISTY *ahem* how utterly tender and heartbreaking this book would be. Christy is the Queen of the ugly cry books and I don't know why I didn't remember that.
Anyways, this book was beautiful. I thought Bristol and Grip's story had wrapped up pretty well in the book before, but this one was a look into the happily ever after and them working on keeping their love intact. If Grip was about getting to the love, this book was about what you do with love once you've found it.
Kennedy Ryan has such beautiful words! Nothing is half done in this book, you can tell the author poured her heart and soul into this story and these characters. Ryan has found a forever fan in me, and she doesn't even realized the level of fangirl she has activated in me.
Top recommendation and this series is one of my favorite I've read this year. I'm going to be pushing Bristol and Grip's story onto anyone and everyone who will listen!

The twists in this book have literally turned my brain to mush. I'm sitting here dumbfounded by the final twist unable to find more words to do this book justice. This book is one of the best twisty-turny psychological thrillers Ive ever read. Pure genius and you won't see half of it coming until it slaps you across the face.
The plot sizzles. It's electrifying and intriguing. A woman in a coma. Secrets. A past that impacts the present. Loyalties. Dysfunctional, damaged and screwed up characters that I loved to love then loved to despise. I thought this book was good from the start but by the ending it propelled into the brilliance category.
This could very well be THE talked about psychological thriller of 2017 and you need to get this one to read any which way you can. This makes The Girl on the Train looks like child's play. This novel messed with my head. I may be recovering for quite some time. Everything just works.
Plot. Characters. Reveals. Twists. Prose. Everything is 5 star in this one and it's in my short list of Top 17 books of 2017, highly likely to get a top spot. If they don't make a movie about this book I'll be starting a personal petition to do so. Absolutely brilliant, entertaining and clever fiction!
This is one talented author. Oh yes indeed. If you love a good twist you will adore this book. I recommend it to everyone. Anyone that reads books. I was honestly stunned at the end of the book. You know those moments? What the..? Holy flak Batman!

,"Fiction, Contemporary, Literary Fiction, Novels",Lisasue,"One of the most thought-provoking novels that I've ever read...like...wake up in the middle of the night kind of thoughts. I have a few things to say on this one that are not completely redundant to other reviews, so....review to follow when I have more time.
OK....so...later....
After thinking for awhile, I have to say that I think that the point of this novel is not about the repulsiveness of Luther Dunphy's family vs. the elevated elegance of the Voorhees family. Some reviewers have said this, and I think that they're all wrong. The point of the novel, at least for me, is that both of these families have adult members who are just bad at being human , leaving their children in a lurch when tragedy strikes. It is easy to look at the surface of things in this novel, to be repulsed by the blind, narrow faith that warps the lives of the Dunphys into destructive knots, but in many ways, the Voorhees family is equally repulsive. While the Dunphy family is hampered by poverty, and a horrific destructive faith, the Voorhees family is educated, but manages to be completely out of touch with their emotions and the emotions of others much of the time. Luther Dunphy lacks a meaningful inner life, and fills it with scripture, and the domination of others. He memorizes scripture, but can't manage to write a decent sermon that involves his own interpretations. When jailed, he seems content; there are no decisions or the daily grind of personal sacrifice that is needed in family life. In comparison, the Voorhees adults do equally poorly. Grandmother Voorhees doesn't want to be a mother, so walks away from her toddler son, and initially can't bear the intimacy of her needy grand-daughter. Mother Voorhees? No better. (view spoiler)
In the end, I think what makes us human, and not animal alone, is when we continue to reach out to other humans, to teach, to help, to nurture, to learn, to connect. Many of the characters in this novel fail to do this, for a variety of reasons, leaving their children to teach themselves how to be human, with varying levels of success. IMHO, the point that Joyce Carol Oates is trying to make is that we must have meaningful connections with other humans: mother/child, siblings, husband/wife to be functional humans. To be better humans, we must be part of a clan, of some kind. For me, that was the ultimate message of the novel. Life is messy. Life is complicated. There is rarely true black or white, good or evil. There is only just us, humans, making our way through it, hopefully with the help of other humans. (less)",Positif
,"Mystery, Fiction, Thriller, Contemporary, Mystery Thriller",Kristin (KC) - Traveling Sister,"*5 stars*
Amy Engelâ€™s writing is as powerful as this story's subject matter is unsettling. Itâ€™s a forceful combination; one that had my churning stomach forever at odds with my growing curiosity and admiration for these tortured Roanoke Girls and their legacy of heartache.
Roanoke girls never last long around here. In the end, we either run or we die.
This storyâ€™s tone is dark and haunting, and its content downright appalling. But, if you give the plot enough time to show its face, youâ€™ll find that it becomes so much more than just an ugly representation of its charactersâ€™ flaws.
Because there is beauty in digging yourself out of the dirt you that bred you - no one expects you to come out of it clean, but the point is, to rise up. As for the Roanoke Girls, many of them proved too dejected, and then there was Lane.
Sometimes itâ€™s a revelation, even to me, how much more comfortable I am with cruelty than with kindness.
After spending one staggering summer at the poisonous Roanoke house, Lane bolts, vowing never to return to her Granddadâ€™s estate, where dysfunction breeds and forbidden secrets roam the halls like restless ghosts.
But when Laneâ€™s cousin Allegra goes missing, their unlikely bond that formed during that ominous summer ten years ago has her fleeing back to the Roanoke house, determined to find her cousin.
This authorâ€™s writing is so compelling and may pull you in deeper than your willing to go, but try to trust the hand that leads you. The *grotesque* element in this story lies heavy in its pages and doesn't dieâ€”it is obvious, and it is â€œknownâ€â€”but the few graphic displays are mercifully delivered in mild detail.
The connection between Lane and Allegra was my favorite aspect of this story. It was offbeat and imperfect, but powerful and unwavering. Beyond the shadows of their flaws and disastrous childhoods were glimpses of two young girls with regular desires for fun and love and acceptanceâ€”a normalcy typically taken for granted.
There is a slow-burning love story woven in, and although it doesn't necessarily become the storyâ€™s focal point, its heartwarming presence softens the rough edges. The first person narration was quick and witty and filled with a dry humor that I particularly enjoyed.
Her smile is so painfully polite it might as well be outlined in frosting.
This book (as with most) is not a one-size-fits-all kind of deal. There are potential emotional triggers present and one should take caution before jumping in.
But you will get a beautifully written piece that, although not the easiest to digest, does present hope in its final pages. Above all, this story makes you FEEL â€¦ anger, disgust, sadness, pain, misguided love, disbelief, failure, triumph, loyalty, broken hearts and ones on the mend â€¦ itâ€™s all there waiting to be absorbed.
Iâ€™ll leave you with a completely *spoiler-free* portion of the book where the writing hit me the hardest. I was so caught up in this particular moment that it actually took my breath away, and not from sadness alone, but from the impact of so much building emotion. This is where the book became something extraordinary for me:
I could never say aloud â€¦ How sometimes when I whispered those awful words to my mother the veins in her neck stood out so far from her skin that I thought they might explode. How her fingernails would leave red welts down the the side of her face. On the nights my words cut deepest, sliced quick and deadly as scalpels, her eyes practically bulged from her face, and I was filled with a rotten, hellish joy because at least she was finally looking at me. At least she finally, finally saw me. â€œStop it,â€ she screamed sometimes, staring at me from between the bars of her fingers. â€œStop it, you evil little bitch! Stop it! Stop it!â€ To me, it might as well have been a love song.
Pre-review: All library loans come through on the same day just as NetGalley approves enough books to drop my feedback ratio below the recommended 80% and my finsh-the-book-on-time-anxiety level hits an all-time high ... I don't know how all you awesome book bloggers/blog tourers do it!

,"Nonfiction, Science, Technology, Politics, Business",Charles,"Franklin Foerâ€™s â€œWorld Without Mindâ€ is an excellent book. It identifies important problems, ties the problems to their historical precedents, and suggests some reasonable solutions. The book is not complete, or perfect, but in the emerging literature of why and how to curb the power of giant technology companies, this book is a useful introduction, although there is a long way to go from here to there.
Foer is primarily known as having been editor of â€œThe New Republic,â€ for several years during the modern era, ending in 2014. Editors come and go, of course, but at the time his dismissal by a new owner felt like a watershed event among the chattering classes in America. This was because the new owner was Chris Hughesâ€”a man of distinctly modest talent and even more modest accomplishments, who became filthy rich by the happenstance of being Mark Zuckerbergâ€™s roommate at Harvard. Hughes, after a brief period of operating The New Republic in close cooperation with Foer, using traditional (i.e., money-losing) journalism, hired some eighth-rate web traffic geek to turn the magazine into clickbait. In that environment, of course, Foer was of no use, so Hughes fired him in the boorish and incompetent manner typical of nouveau riche men of his generation and class. (Hughes no longer owns the magazine, having failed even at operating a clickbait site, and has since moved on to other failures.)
In part, as he admits, Foer wrote his book in response to these events. But this is not a revenge job; itâ€™s just that the story of The New Republicâ€™s travails is illuminating to Foerâ€™s points. Those points are clearly and well made. Yes, Foer seems to think that most history began in the 1960s, with perhaps a few events from the 1700s onward being mildly relevant. But that is an occupational hazard for the educated members of Generation X, and, after all, most of the relevant history to this book began in the 1990s, so if you must have a narrow historical vision, it might as well be in a book about the evils of modern technology firms.
Foer begins with a Prologue, which in many ways is the most intriguing part of the book. Here Foer introduces a key historical parallel for the book, 1950s and 1960s food re-engineering creating the dominance of processed food and frozen dinners. He analogizes that change to the emergent dominance of the technology companies (by which he means â€œGAFAâ€â€”Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon). As far as food goes, we were promised â€œconvenience, efficiency, and abundance.â€ We got itâ€”and we also, without meaning to, hugely damaged â€œour waistline, longevity, soul, and planet.â€ We were promised similar, but more utopian, benefits by the GAFA companies, some of which we got, along with a heaping of unexpected Bad Things. This tension, between the promises of technology and its costs, is the backbone of Foerâ€™s book.
In his Prologue, Foer also lays out a philosophical framework, focusing on what I think is the critical point. â€œMore than any other previous coterie of corporations, the tech monopolists aspire to mold humanity into their desired image of it.â€ Although he does not use these terms, Foerâ€™s basic point throughout the book is that the GAFA companies and their masters deny the telos of man. They refuse to acknowledge that man has an inherent nature or purpose. Instead, they view humanity in purely instrumentalist terms, subject to unending manipulationâ€”all for mankindâ€™s own improvement, of course, as well as their profit. Thus, while Silicon Valley is often viewed as libertarian, it is notâ€”it is monopolist in economic intent and collectivist utopian in social intent, even if that utopia uses the superficial language of liberty. Silicon Valley considers â€œthe concentration of power in its companies . . . an urgent social good, the precursor to global harmony; a necessary condition for undoing the alienation of mankind.â€ This utopia is a collectivist one, not one personal to the individual. In fact, Foer even semi-lyrically complains (not citing Josef Pieper, though he should) that â€œThe tech companies are destroying something precious, which is the possibility of contemplation.â€ And, even if such a utopia may seem desirable, Foer think that utopia is not on its way. Rather, we face enforced conformity, a total loss of privacy, the erosion of thoughtful self-government, and the hobbling of creative genius. Weâ€™re becoming Spamâ€”a mediocre, indistinguishable, controlled mass of meat contained in a metaphysical box.
Foer traces this desire by the masters of GAFA, for global harmony and the end of alienation, to the 1960s. More precisely, to Stewart Brand, who founded the â€œWhole Earth Catalog,â€ and to other pop culture icons like Marshall McLuhan. While I suppose this is true in part, it is a crimped vision. Seeking, and believing you have found, the key to global harmony and the end of alienation has a vastly longer pedigreeâ€”through Marxism and its variants; through 19th Century German philosophy; and through much Enlightenment thought. Of course, as Foer sometimes seems to hint, these latter day eschatons are mere secular versions of the ancient Judeo-Christian vision, and Facebook and Google merely offer different re-workings of the Serpent in the Garden, promising us that we will be as gods. Stewart Brand and other hippies are, in truth, irrelevant carbuncles on the shoulders of giants. But Foerâ€™s basic point is true enoughâ€”this vision was influential in forming the vision of todayâ€™s tech leaders, and it is utopian in form and content. Despite the libertarian stereotype, it is â€œthe exact opposite of Ayn Randâ€™s vision of libertarianism; [it is] a hunger for cooperation, sharing, and a self-conscious awareness of our place in a larger system.â€
â€œWorld Without Mindâ€ addresses each of the GAFA firms in turn, with a focus on the history of each as it relates to Foerâ€™s theses. None of these companies, of course, produce any relevant amount of knowledge. They are instead gatekeepers and filters, offering efficiency to consumers in exchange for a piece of the action. Foer does not object to the gatekeeper role, as such. He is perfectly well aware that the mass of information that is the Internet cannot be directly addressed by any human and still be of any use. He notes that in the past journalists (totally coincidentally, people just like him) were the honored gatekeepers of both information and its importance, as well as arbiters of much of culture. His Golden Age is the time when the owners of the Washington Post honored objectivity, de-emphasized profitability, and regarded their news outlets as a public trust. Foer is aware that this Golden Age was sometimes tarnished, although his examples tend to focus on the clichÃ©d (they enabled Nixon!), not the real (conservatives have been suppressed for decades). But again, his basic point, that the GAFA companies are more like Cerberus out for a snack than a paladin keeping enemies out of the gate, is sound.
Foer begins with Google, noting that Google regards its actual mission as creating strong AI, followed by augmented humanity and a world where scarcity has been eliminated and all limits on man disappear. I have long known this (it is not like Google keeps it a secret, though few seem to focus on it), but my reaction has always been that Google will ultimately collapse, since this is a stupid business model. Any company that hires Ray Kurzweil to be a top executive is delusional and wasting the shareholdersâ€™ moneyâ€”if the goal is to offer the shareholders money, which here it isnâ€™t. As Foer says, Kurzweilâ€™s â€œmain business is prophecy.â€ Prophecy does not pay the bills, or at least false prophecy doesnâ€™t. But Foer is correct, and my old reaction was wrongâ€”the business model doesnâ€™t require competition to survive if Google has carved out a niche of permanent dominance, by having such an amount of data that no competitor can even begin to think of competing, and if it has, it can do whatever it wants, whether it makes any business sense or not. Next comes Facebook, whose goal is not the creation of non-human progress, but rather directly augmenting human social progress, by bringing people together, while at the same time telling them what thoughts are permitted to think, and increasingly manipulating them into what to think. Facebookâ€™s focus is algorithmic thinking to apply that data, to which outsiders are not privy, only the priests of Zuckerberg. Finally, Amazon monopolizes power over authors (Foer mostly ignores Amazonâ€™s non-book sales) and thereby erodes authorial incentive, thereby crushing genius. Amazon crushes authorial genius in books; Google and Facebook do it in newspapers and periodicals; Apple erodes it in music (Apple gets the least direct abuse in this book, implicitly because it has the least power of the type Foer complains of).
But before we get to authorial incentive, we should treat Foerâ€™s grander, if less visceral, objection to the behavior of the GAFA companies. That is, why is any of this a problem? It is because their power is destroying our ability to govern ourselves. They are â€œknowledge monopolies,â€ a new variation on an old theme. Foerâ€™s other Golden Age is one, from roughly 1880 to 1980, when antitrust enforcement was much more aggressive than today. He divides that into two time periods, though, only one of which he feels should be our new model. In earlier years, monopoly was viewed, by men such as Louis Brandeis, through the Jeffersonian lens of an unhealthy concentration of power tending to the degradation of democracy through its corruption of the democratic process. In later years, however, from roughly 1940 on, monopolies came to be viewed by enforcers only as a problem when they harmed consumers, by raising prices or reducing choiceâ€”that is, when they were inefficient. The problem, though, is that todayâ€™s monopolies, at least on the surface, benefit consumers quite a bit. They are extremely efficient in that sense. Thus, when in the 1970s academics such as Robert Bork pushed to revise the law to, in effect, only recognize this latter theory, and this view became wholly dominant, the tools to attack monopoly as a broader menace to our society had disappeared. Foer wants to restore those tools, for, as he says, â€œThe Framers preferred liberty to efficiency,â€ because any monopoly is ultimately the enemy of liberty, especially a monopoly with power over knowledge and communication, which tends to create conformity, the bane of a free people.
As to authorial incentive, there is little doubt that the GAFA companies have reduced the power of, and payments to, authors, which must necessarily reduce incentive to create. Foer sees keeping such payments high as a key pillar of our society. To demonstrate this, he focuses on copyright. He claims that â€œone of [governmentâ€™s] primary economic responsibilities is preserving the value of knowledge.â€ Although there is something to this, and Foer cites both the Constitution and the 1710 Statute of Anne, the progenitor of generally applicable copyright law, he reaches too far when he claims, in essence, that todayâ€™s copyright law is a critical element of our entire social system, and, by implication, if authors get paid less due to changing competition, it tears at the fabric of our society. For one, we got by just fine when copyright lengths were far shorter (a maximum of 28 years until relatively recentlyâ€”now itâ€™s the entire life of the author plus 70 years!). (It is both not true as a reason for the growth of copyright, and an anachronism as an argument, when, speaking of Wordsworth and early copyright, Foer says â€œBecause poets were rarely appreciated in their own time, copyright protections needed to be lengthyâ€”so that there was enough time for the publicâ€™s taste to catch up with genius.â€) For another, we got by just fine when there was no copyright at all, and when it was spotty in framework and enforcement. Sure, thereâ€™s a good argument that more rigid copyright helps authorial creativity and production. Yes, Larry Lessig makes far too broad claims, and yes, anyone who believes â€œinformation wants to be freeâ€ is an idiot. Yes, the theory that crowdsourced authoring, such as Wikipedia, can compete in accuracy of content or style of delivery with professional, paid content has proven utterly false, as has the idea that crowdsourced anything offers a viable model to replace any paid model with something qualitatively better (other than, perhaps, reviews of consumer products and services). But letâ€™s not elevate any of this to a core principle of good government. Moreover, Amazon is not Napster. Foerâ€™s objection is that Amazon devalues the traditional hierarchy of authors imposed by publishing houses, instead substituting the whims of the market, and also eroding the power of the publishing houses through its economic dominance. All true, but this is not theft, and copyright law seems to be working as itâ€™s supposed to for authors. So, itâ€™s probably inaccurate to call Amazon a â€œknowledge monopolyâ€â€”it is more of a monopsonist, one whose dominance over the buyerâ€™s market, in this case as middleman, allows it to set prices. â€œMonopolyâ€ is a term better suited to Google and Facebook (although they too erode authorial incentive, as a side effort to controlling the flow of information). This is a less sexy and less compelling claim, though, than that all four GAFA companies are a monolith placing dynamite at the foundation of society.
Regardless of which company should be focus, Foer offers a set of solutions to his two identified problems. First, we should restore the old understanding of monopoly, and the federal government should take aggressive enforcement action. Any firm that controls knowledge to a great degree, especially one that filters that knowledge in a non-neutral way, should be curbed or broken. Second, and buttressing this effort, new regulations, under the aegis of a â€œData Protection Authority,â€ should be created to sharply limit the collection and use of data by technology companies, including requiring automatic deletion of data except upon opt-in and â€œinsist[ing] that they provide equal access to a multiplicity of sources and viewpoints.â€ Third, we should all realize we need to pay, and we should go back to paying, for quality authorial work, rather than thinking content should be free, and thereby both undercutting authorship and allowing Google and Facebook to direct us, unknowingly, to content they select that we should be consciously choosing for ourselves. Fourth, as with the way much of America has recoiled from processed food, factory farming and other perceived evils (even though that is often â€œreally purchasing the sensation of virtue and rectitudeâ€), we should seek to restore â€œcachetâ€ to â€œbooks, essays, and journalism.â€ In other words, we should be more highbrow.
I think, at a minimum in the abstract, all of these are good ideas. I, at least, had already started subscribing to more and more periodicals, in paper form, and have abandoned my Kindle, as has Foer. If Iâ€™ve done it, there must be something to it! I think, though, that absolute neutrality for all non-obscene content should be required, not just offering â€œa multiplicity of sources and viewpoints,â€ which is just another word for picking and choosing what is permitted to think. Any technology company that censors any non-obscene content for non-viewpoint neutral reasons should be subject to massive government fines and a private right of action with huge statutory monetary damages. But these are detailsâ€”the question now is, how can we get this party started?
Foer explicitly thinks that while these proposals seem unlikely to be accepted, that there will be some â€œcatastrophe,â€ a â€œBig One,â€ where some mass exposure of private data will cause such damage to the average person that voters will demand something be done. This is certainly possible (the recent Equifax hack tends in this direction, though it is far from catastrophic enough). Foer says â€œThe best analogy is the financial crisis of 2008. There was nothing that the banks could do to gain political traction in the face of the catastrophe that they unleashed.â€ Really? In the world I live in, corrupt politicians cooperated with corrupt bankers to make sure banks were completely insulated from the effects of their actions, and exited the 2008 crisis in far better shape than before, having paid no price at all, and passed all the costs on to the average American. Itâ€™s the latter, not banks, who lack â€œpolitical traction.â€ In fact, I am willing to bet most dictionaries today illustrate their entry for â€œpolitical tractionâ€ with a line drawing of Jamie Dimon. This weak analogy suggests the key flaw in Foerâ€™s hopeâ€”catastrophes nowadays are used by the powerful to advance their own interests, not to make changes for the benefit of society as a whole. In all likelihood, unfortunately, the same would happen in a catastrophic data breach.
Some argue that action is not necessary, only more competition over time. Once Microsoft was dominant; now it is not (though it still dominates certain software markets). Once buggy whips were sold all over America. At some point in the near future, probably sooner rather than later, so the argument goes, the GAFA companies will also cede their dominance to new competition. Foer disagreesâ€”he thinks that the collection of data these companies have make them nearly impossible to dislodge from their position. Another argument, made by Tim Wu in â€œThe Attention Merchants,â€ is that it is primarily our job, not the governmentâ€™s, to change things. Foer certainly agrees with this in part, as shown by his strong advocacy of returning to paid content and his suggestion that readers, by their consumer choices, have the ability to reverse the monopolistic dominance of the GAFA companies. That is, even aside from any government action, we have the power to redirect our attention. A third argument, related to the second, is that the system we have is what the people want. We get what we deserve, and just because itâ€™s trashy and damaging doesnâ€™t mean we donâ€™t deserve it. Foer, certainly, overstates the ability of the masses to appreciate high-level thought and culture. They want Upworthy, not â€œThe New Yorker.â€ Foer ascribes the decline of mass appreciation for classical music to Baumolâ€™s cost disease (where activities that have not increased in productivity over time, such as live music performances, become relatively more expensive). That doesnâ€™t even make any senseâ€”live performances are not how classical music is consumed; excellent recordings have been ubiquitous for nearly a century. The decline is much more likely because the coarse tastes of the common people have become economically, and therefore socially, dominant. (For the record, I cannot myself appreciate classical music at all; it all sounds like elevator music to me. I prefer EDM, thus exhibiting my own coarseness.) While these arguments may have something to them, they do not contradict Foerâ€™s core assertion that aggressive government control of knowledge monopolies, now, will benefit society.

,"Media Tie , Fiction, Science Fiction, Young Adult",Jason,"Star Wars - The Legends of Luke Skywalker â€“ Ken Liu
The Legends of Luke Skywalker is a collection of tales about Luke as told by a group of kids aboard a freighter on a long haul mission. The kids are all under the care of a Matriarch type figure who looks after them, and in turn, the kids (who are all in the young teens by human comparison, but there are a variety of the various Star Wars aliens represented), do work for her. It is a good arrangement, and the kids would be on the street getting lost in the filth of somewhere like Canto Bight or somewhere similar otherwise.
Each night when making the evening meal, the cook regales them with a tale about the universe, and tonight, it is about Luke Skywalker. And thus begins â€˜The Interlude Taleâ€™. As the story progresses, the kids are involved in their own storyline, broken up into multiple â€˜Interludesâ€™ and between each of them is a Luke Skywalker story, one of the Legends. The actual Interlude story was not too bad, aimed obviously at a YA audience, as most of the stories are, but unfortunately, the quality of the Luke Skywalker Legends is absolutely dreadful for the most part and does not do the Interlude Tale justice.
The Myth Buster â€“ 1/5 â€“ is a short story told from the point of view of an old alien in a cantina, about how the entire series of events in A New Hope, Episode IV were actually made up by a bunch of con-men. She is actually running a con herself, using the stories to get food and drinks, which is amusing. Her story is how they entire thing is a lie upon a lie, and that the Empire made up the Death Star, and then the Rebellion made up Yavin 4 with the help of a bunch of con-men, who end up being Ben, Han, Chewie and of course, the poster boy Luke. The story had a lot of potential, but just became silly, and even worse when you work out that Luke is sitting there listening the whole time. Bad conspiracy theories told by a bitter Scully wannbe in a grubby pub where Luke would never be.
The Starship Graveyard â€“ 3/5 â€“ This one is about the battle over Jaku, and how Luke was actually there, jumping from ship to ship, killing Star Destroyers with his lightsaber?? It kind of left you wondering ah what?
After the battle he is on the planet, and rescues a seriously wounded Imperial Gunner, and the story is told from the point of view of the Gunner as they trek through the deserts trying to find help and rescue. The Gunner is of course against our Hero, but at the same time is enamoured by him. It is a bit strange in parts, and towards the end became silly with one aspect of the story, detracting from the whole thing. It could have been done better and certainly ended better providing a much better â€˜Legendâ€™. Disappointing.
Fishing in the Deluge â€“ 4/5 â€“ is about how Luke visits a planet to learn about â€˜The Tideâ€™, what the inhabitants of this planet call â€˜The Forceâ€™. It is actually one of the better stories in this collection, showing Luke on a journey to learn about the ways of the Force on his path to become a better Jedi. This was an interesting read, with some good characters and some really great world building. The clever use of The Force and The Tide as to social and cultural constructs of the same life giving entity were very well done. This was easily the best of the stories. Some beautiful descriptions of the creatures as well.
I, Droid â€“ 3/5 â€“ This story was about this elitist group of people who like to think they are special, and to do so, they need to mine a special gem that they can sell to maintain their luxurious lifestyle. Only droids can do this, so they constantly kidnap droids and put them to their deaths in this mining trap, where they only last a few months mining this rare gem. R2-D2 is one of them, and eventually Luke comes for him. It was OK, given most of the stories in this collection, it was actually not bad, but given what we normally expect, it was pretty poor.
The Tale of Lugubrious Mote â€“ 1/5 â€“ This one is a short story about when Luke came to Jabbaâ€™s Palace, told from the point of view of a tiny flea that is a sentient creature that lives on the skin of Kowakian Monkey Lizard, namely Salacious Crumb. The little worm claims that he is the inspirations for Salacious Crumb, as Crumb was totally useless at telling jokes, and that he helped Leia and Luke as they were idiots and would have died without his help. The story kind of grated on me as it made Luke out to be this dim-witted moron who sat in the Rancor cave going, â€˜The Force will save meâ€™, and other equally stupid comments, making Gamorrean Guards look intelligent. It just didnâ€™t fit into a set of stories about how Luke is a Legend, when the entire tale was how he was the biggest idiot in the whole Galaxy (even dumber than Lois Lane). And the flea was really irritating apart from that. This could have been clever, but was just annoying.
At the end of the all â€˜So Called Legendsâ€™ the Interludes wrap up with the last bit, and I have to point out a bit that annoyed me, attention to detail. When people are climbing through sewers and mud, as they walk off, their White dress is NOT going to gleam brightly in the sunlight, no matter how much you rinse it, not even if you bleach it.
Not unless it is made from some special fabric that every cleaner in the universe wants to get hold of. (less)",Negatif
,"Young Adult, Fiction, Contemporary, Realistic Fiction",Lola,"â€˜â€˜A hairbrush is not a gun.â€™â€™
This doesnâ€™t make any sense. And I hope that to you, too, it will not make any sense.
Starr may only be sixteen, but she has already witnessed two murders in her life: the first of a young black girl in a drive by and the second of a young black boy shot multiple times by a cop.
While she was in the car. Even though they didnâ€™t do anything wrong. Even though he was unarmed.
â€˜â€˜A hairbrush is not a gun.â€™â€™
Does that make any sense to you? You canâ€™t just kill someone because, to you, they look threatening. Are you a seer? Can you predict that they will reach for a gun and kill you with it?
No, you cannot. (Even then it wouldnâ€™t be completely right.) You have no right to take an innocent life like that.
Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, this important novel tackles issues of race in society involving the black community of people and authority figures, more precisely, police officers.
Starr was never taught to fear cops, but she was taught to be smart around them. Do what they ask, even if what they ask for makes no sense.
But because of what has happened to her childhood friend Khalil, she becomes scared. Scared enough to speak up about what she witnessed, though? Will she gather her courage to do what is right?
â€˜â€˜A hairbrush is not a gun.â€™â€™
This story needed to be told. It has been told orally and on paper many times before, unfortunately, but it was time someone wrote a book dealing with social issues of race like the ones here for a young audience.
For young people are dying. Young black people. Black boys. Black girls.
This novel educates. It may be fictional in the sense that Angie Thomas created this story using fictional characters, but what happens in it is scary real.
It does feel like it was written for white folks, but it sure as hell didnâ€™t need to be written for black ones specifically.

I wonder if anyone with bulky muscular arms is willing to hug me right now, I want to be compressed back to death because Iâ€™ve decided to abandon humanity to become an orb of energy and light instead and just live photogenically until The Muse of Nightmares is out.
â€œBeautiful and full of monsters?â€
â€œAll the best stories are.â€
How much money do you think I should invest in the search for immortality for Laini Taylor to keep her as a story teller forever?
Because gosh, I love her writing and the way she tells her stories so much that my heart actually threatens to break out of my collarbone.
I swear itâ€™s like youâ€™re reading and you can just see yourself sipping champagne on a balcony overlooking Paris at sunset in a silk robe with roses all around and a fountain in the background. Her writing is the equivalent of honey dripping off a spoon over a toasted bagel and I don't know how else to describe it but thereâ€™s just something incredibly soothing about it. Like a memory foam mattress with underfloor heating and you just want to sink in. It's the feeling of wanting to float around as collections of rose petals like the nymphs in narnia. It's your eyelashes stuck together from crying, and lana songs playing and you just want to claw your way out of your body into a warm slipstream and just let the current wash you away.
And you really have no idea how I wish I could tattoo that feeling and carry it around with me forever.
So. What is Strange the Dreamer about?
Itâ€™s a story of a city that lost its name and was lost to the world, of blue-skinned goddesses who appear in the dreams of men and moths who infiltrate their unconsciousness.
Of ghosts bound to a childâ€™s will and orphans who inherited tales of hate, of dragonfly wings purchased in dreams and noses literally broken by fairy tales, of heroes with untold stories or rather stories stolen by imposter heroes.
Of dreamsmiths who â€œturn their nightmares into fireflies and catch them in a jarâ€, of godslayers and great men who are also good men (and the repercussions of being both)
And of beginning that are very literally endings and of a character who â€œcouldnâ€™t have belonged at the library more truly if he were a book himselfâ€.
It's a story I wish I could purchase another heart entirely just to love it with.
The characters:
I love how you can see a little fragment of yourself in Laini Taylor's characters' eyes. Especially when these characters have been fragmented in so many pieces so many times in so many different ways and you can recognize parts of yourself in their anger and guilt and bitterness and loneliness and desire to be more than this (where this translates to everything). In the way theyâ€™re constantly trying to stitch themselves back together and wondering if it will ever be the same Original image, if the pieces will ever fit again.
And if thereâ€™s anything I like more than flawed characters and characters you can relate to, itâ€™s flawed characters that you can relate to.
âœ¨ Lazlo Strange
I can't remember if I had a personality before loving Lazlo Strange but at this point it's quite irrelevant.
Lazlo Strange makes me want to reinvent myself as the concept of kindness and stop glorifying bitterness and saltiness and start promoting the idea of being nice to people â€œsimply because they needed itâ€ (and not necessarily because theydeserve it)
He is the kind of person that is so deeply kind and compassionate that you would listen to them speak and itâ€™s like you're watering your heart and soul garden. And I just can't believe the world isn't catered to making him feel good and content, because let me tell you: being kind and gentle and vulnerable when you have been exposed to less than zero modeling of that behavior is not easy and Lazlo Strange does it every day and honestly?? He can use my body as a canoe and row himself across the toxic waste, he deserves only the softest cashmere.
Letâ€™s not also forget that he's a reader but most importantly heâ€™s a book lover. And I'm sure in an alternate universe, he would pick me up at 3am and have night adventures with me in a desolate library or he and I could be sharing harry potter celebration boxes harmoniously and that would have been perfect.
â€œHe read while he walked. He read while he ate. The other librarians suspected he somehow read while he slept, or perhaps didnâ€™t sleep at all.â€
He's also an introvert. The kind of introvert who's constantly trying to astral project into a library with soft candle lightning and the warm sound of silence. Who gets what it's like to be a lizard person in human skin trying too hard to fit into society but not understanding the appropriate level of eye contact nor how to talk about his passions (books) in a moderate amount.
So hey @universe, when is a certain lazlo strange going to manifest in my life?? [tapping my watch passive aggressively]
âœ¨ Sarai
â€œIt was no small thing to shed a lifetime of nonbeing and suddenly be seen.â€
Sarai is the blue-skinned goddess who infiltrates dreams and turns them into nightmares. Except sheâ€™s also just a child whoâ€™s inherited a story of hate and revenge, like being rendered a solid object with a parental control lock on it.
Which just goes to show you that is so fucked up how much value is placed on family in the sense of blood, when you have at least six genetic twins somewhere around the world but nobody tries to make you feel bad because you donâ€™t love them just because youâ€™re made of the same stuff (or in saraiâ€™s case, because you wouldnâ€™t carry on their petty revenge agenda).
And you know what? I just want to build a spotless and aesthetically pleasing floating citadel with her and go live in it and be sexy goddesses together and do nothing but insert god's fear in the hearts of all men.
âœ¨Sarai x Lazlo
I think my biggest shift in perspective has been going from being aggressively anti-instalove to not giving a fragmented fuck that technically this was insta-love. I just really love these two dorks so much together and I love that they're willing to be unattractive in front of each other. I'm trash for this warm kind of intimacy, tbh.
âœ¨ Thyon Nero
I have a lot of inner conflict regarding thyon because on one hand, I hate him with a casanovian passion, and on the other, I just want to stroke his hair gently because honestly sometimes you just lose track of where â€œtrying to protect yourselfâ€ ends and â€œselfishnessâ€ begins. Sometimes you succumb to jealousy and self-pity and bitterness and you lose track of yourself. Sometimes your defense mechanism kicks in and you hurt before you get hurt.
I feel bad for Thyon but seriously. If he hurts my child (Lazlo), the dealâ€™s off the table.
âœ¨ Minya
How cool is it to get to hang out with ghosts?? (says me who in case sheâ€™s ever had a paranormal experience, sheâ€™ll probably immediately have a heart attack and die)
Except in this scenario, Minya gets said ghost to hang out with her. And by hanging out, I donâ€™t mean teaming up to scare the rude old lady that lives across the street. I mean it in the sense that she catches them like one would catch butterflies in a net and keeps them to do her binding and cede to her every whim.
Which is seven shades of gruesome but I refuse to believe for one second that Minya is just that. Not when I feel like my heart has just been torn into a million pieces and scattered across the desert to be picked at by vultures whenever I think about her and â€œthey were all i could carry, they were all i could carryâ€.
I really just hope everyone sees through her thick armor of bullshit and glimpse the confused and hurt and lonely child inside whoâ€™s only ever wanted to protect her family.
Oh and on a side note, that ending was just pure cruelty, Laini Taylor. Pure fucking cruelty.
Overall: this was awesome and I'd totally recommend it because everyone needs to read this extraordianary fucking book

This being the 7th book in the series, I can honestly say that the Cold Fury Series has become one of my favorite sports romance series of all time! Every single book that I have read in this ice hockey based romance has been top-notch: both complex in its character and plot development and touching and heart-felt in its romance. Not to mention that each book is fresh and unique in its storyline (no cookie cutter series driven formula here!) Roman is no exception, and left me eagerly turning pages to see how the two embedded romances (that's right you get 2 romances for the price of 1 in this book!), not to mention the interesting family dynamics combined with a conflict-driven business overlay would be resolved.
Lexi Robertson has just had a bombshell revelation, and following her mother's death and left with no family, she decides to move to Raleigh, North Carolina to explore this long-held secret. Brian Brannon, the owner of the Cold Fury Ice Hockey professional team, is her father! But will she ever be able to convince Brian, a rich and powerful man who will no doubt be suspicious of any such allegations, and Gray Brannon his only daughter who maintains a very close (and protective) relationship with him and who indeed is now the general manager of the Cold Fury team, that she is their long-lost daughter and sister?
Further complicating matters is that Lexi is nothing like Brian or Gray. She isn't college educated and can at best be described as a free-spirited, musician and ukuele player who works as a barrista for a living. While Brian and Gray run an ice hockey empire and Gray was even a hockey gold medalist herself! What can Lexie possibly have in common with Brian and Gray who are known for their hard-driven, Type A personalities?
As Lexi is beginning to be acquainted with her new family she also meets Roman Sykora, the bad boy defenseman of the Cold Fury Team. Known for never backing down from a fight, nevermind his playboy ways, and a knack for attracting negative publicity, he is one of Gray's least favorite players, even if his results on the ice rink are undeniable. Roman and Lexi instantly hit it off, but that only further complicates the budding family relationship between the Brannons and Lexi given Gray's heated exchanges with Roman about shaping up or being traded from the team. Additionally, the fact that Roman has never really had a family who took an interest in him makes his desire to interact with anyone else's family (even if it is the first girl ever who has made him want more than a one night stand) an extra barrier to the development of both Lexi's new family ties and love interest in Roman.
But that is not all! In an already full plot, Ms. Sawyer manages to squeeze in yet one more surprise. All I will say is that even widowers have a chance to find love again! In addition to the plot I highly enjoyed Ms. Sawyer's engaging writing which kept me glued to my Kindle from page 1 to the very end!

Now ready to head back home she's spending her last days in Paris where she will be joined by her brother Cullen & his best friend Smith. Smith Hamilton is Evie's older brother's hot, off limits best friend. She's wanted him for as long as she can remember. Growing up he was always so kind to her. Now they are both adults & he's smart, sinfully gorgeous, educated and wealthy. He's always had this sexy, wounded alpha male thing going on, & Evie's still crushing hard on him. She wants him to see her as the adult she is. She's never had a man rock her world in bed, & she wants a hot tryst. She has just the man in mind. The one she's always desired. She knows what she wants, has a plan, & is going for it. She'll seduce Smith & he won't know what hit him. She's in the city of romance, and figures it's her perfect chance.

Smith hasn't ever been a relationship guy. He's never let a woman get too close. If he was with Evie things couldn't be casual. He could never hurt her. Too much is at stake. He was in foster care as a child & met the Reed's after being adopted. He still remembers what it was like to have no one & doesn't want to mess up the relationships he has with the family that means everything to him. The Reed's had always accepted him.

Thank you Crown Publishing for sending me a free, finished copy of this book in an exchange for an honest review!
The Windfall revolves around a number of different families and individuals whom their lives changed when Mr. Jha gained millions of dollars by selling his website and decided to move his family into a much bigger house in a fancier neighbourhood.
The story follows the Jha family on their transit from a local complex in East Delhi to a House in Gurgaon: a neighbourhood with high-class houses and families with personal guards, shiny cars, and thousand dollars-worthy jewellery.
The book is dipped in humour and social satire, which are illustrated in poor Mr. Jha's constant pretentious efforts towards his new (and just as wealthy) neighbours: from showing off his family's expensive trip to NY, to constantly mentioning his one and only sonâ€”Rupakâ€”who's doing his MBA abroad.
Despite how i was constantly annoyed by most of the character's behaviours, how pretentious they were, and how all of Mr. Jha's actions were driven by his obsession of impressing and wow-ing their new, wealthy neighbours, the things that made me continue reading were much more dominant. First, Mrs. Jha's kindness and her wit: she was the best out of all The Windfall's characters, one that i couldn't help but enjoy reading about. Then there's how this book exposed me to the Indian culture and some Indian traditionsâ€”which i absolutely loved learning and reading aboutâ€”without having to leave my place. And lastly, the humour that lays within this book's pages.
The Jha's story highlights how one single event or action can lead to changesâ€”both small and hugeâ€”and how our destinies affect those around us both: close and far. (less)",Positif

,"Nonfiction, Science, Technology, Politics, Business",Angie Boyter,"In the Prologue to this book, the author tells us he spent most of his career at the New Republic. When Chris Hughes, who happens to have been Mark Zuckerberg's college roommate, bought the paper, he made Foer editor and tasked him to remake the magazine into a modern publication, befitting the new millennium. He fired Foer 2 1/2 years later when the magazine could not meet Hughes' expectations. Foer says he hopes that this book ""doesn't come across as fueled by anger."" So far he has NOT lived up to his hopes.
I may not last for the duration, especially in the face of a writing style that could be a little less informal and a bit better organized. One common annoyance is that when he is talking about history of tech he is not careful to identify the year or period he is talking about. Sometimes he mentions it in passing well into the discussion or leaves the reader to guess from mention of certain events. Sometimes I never was sure. This is important. For example, if a young person has a personal computer it makes a difference if it is the 1970s, the early 1980s, or the late 80s. One is extraordinary; one is VERY advanced; one is so-so.
OK, I gave up. When I find myself so annoyed by the style that it interferes with my ability to absorb what the author is saying it is time to move on. The writing is just plain sloppy. I found too many instances like when he says that the great sociologist Thorstein Veblen wrote a book making the case for putting engineers into power and uses this to discuss the rise of Herbert Hoover and the increasing importance of engineers as the 20th century progressed. Sounds interesting, but in neither the book nor the endnotes is the Veblen book identified!! (The endnotes are another source of annoyance. I discovered them late. Why? Because there are no footnote numbers or other references to them in the text. A reader has to guess that this might be something for which the author might cite the source and go to the notes, where references are found by page number. ) I am surprised and disappointed that the publisher put the book out for sale in this condition.

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction, Mystery",Esil,"3.5 stars. It's so hard for me to rate this book. I found it had glaring flaws and yet I ripped right through most of it today. I think that tends to be my relationship with Diane Chamberlain's books. Set during WWII, the story focuses on Tess, who lives in Baltimore and is all set to become a nurse and marry her childhood sweetheart. Through events that I won't recount to avoid spoilers, her life is set off course and she finds herself in Hickory, North Carolina, in a loveless marriage with someone other than her childhood sweetheart. Tess' situation gives Chamberlain an opportunity to explore issues of sex, class and race. What struck me as glaring flaws are that Tess is too perfect, there is an overload of dramatic events, the politics are simplistic and, with one notable exception, the story is pretty predictable. But despite these flaws. I did manage to get caught up in the story, wanting to follow Tess through to what one knows will surely be a happy ending. To give Chamberlain more credit, I should also note that, as in many of her books, she highlights an interesting historical event. In this case, the story takes place in Hickory, North Carolina which was particularly hard hit by polio in 1945. Part of the book delves into this devastating disease and how this small town came together to deal with it. Many readers liked this book far more than I did, but despite its flaws, I still enjoyed it enough to be glad I read it.

,"Thriller, Mystery, Fiction, Mystery Thriller, Suspense",Holly B,"A main character who is in a coma and sometimes lies. I'm all in!
Quite a spellbinding read from start to finish. We are not sure how Amber ended up in the hospital in this coma , but she does admit that sometimes she lies. This was like a puzzle and I was trying to put the pieces together, but couldn't entirely trust all the pieces. Very cleverly written and I loved hearing what Amber was thinking while in this coma sizing up everyone in the room and giving us her insight. There was so much going on, I had to hold my breath too keep up.
The narrative switches from Now (in coma) to Then (before the coma). I loved trying to figure out what the lies were and who to trust. It is super twisty and just when you think you have it figured out another twist flies your way. A fast read for me because I needed to find out what was going on.
The ending was my favorite part because it leaves you questioning yourself and if you perhaps missed anything. I have a theory, but I am still questioning myself. Just read it and see what you think .

PROVING GROUND by Peter Blauner, author of Casino Moon, and several other books, begins with Nathaniel Dresden aka â€œNatty Dreadâ€ a soldier in Iraq who is skilled in interrogation. Natty is the son of a well known defense attorney named David Dresden, and was given his nickname by his father David, a Bob Marley fan and a liberal in every sense of the word.
Natty is on the team sent to locate Ahmar, the reported one responsible for the death of a man known to Natty as â€˜Boratâ€™, an informant with a resemblance to the character portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen in the comedy with the same name as the title, and is well like by the American soldiers. Borat has been recently beheaded in front of his family, and the soldiers are out for revenge which leads them to the home of an Iraqi family that a man has said much might be harboring Ahmar.
Tragedy results from their raid on the family's home with Natty responsible for the outcome creating an unshakable image that affects him for the duration of the book.
Later, the story picks up with Natty in jail after putting a probationary fire fighter in NYC in the hospital after a bar brawl the previous night, and we learn Natty was drunk and violent in the wake of his fatherâ€™s murder.
Natty stays with his mother while going through court ordered therapy for PTSD to avoid jail time, and we learn that Natty has been a prosecutor in Florida before coming back home following his fatherâ€™s death.
David, Nattyâ€™s father had been involved in the high-profile case known as â€˜The Mailman Caseâ€™ involving the FBI along with David's partner Ben who has in the past been a mentor to Natty.
Lourdes Robles, a young female detective assigned to her first case since disciplinary action for her previous partnerâ€™s behavior, is assigned to the case along with a long-time veteran named Sullivan.
Natty finds himself a suspect in his own father's murder, which only adds to his already heavy load he's been dealing with as he tries to adapt to civilian life while battling PTSD that comes with suicidal thoughts, and flashbacks to his time in Iraq.
Peter Blauner has written a very good full length novel about a subject that has probably been overdone recently by other authors and screenwriters, yet has done so in a way that makes it not seem clichÃ©d and builds interest as the book progresses detailing Nattyâ€™s past and filling in holes that explain the relationship between him and his mother, father, and Ben.
I'd recommend this book to anyone pulling for someone coming from a difficult situation wanting to come to grips with it and move on, as well as anyone who has an interest in the struggles of a veteran returning to civilian life back home, and this book was even more touching to read over the recent holiday where we honor those who have served, and those who have given their lives for country.

Wellâ€¦
No one can possibly understand how much love and adoration I have for this series. Book one and two were literal obsessions for me. I loved them so deeply that I literally took the time to annoy each and every one of my closest friends who chose to give a shitâ€¦even though 4/5 of them didnâ€™t care for this series. I canâ€™t even count all the times throughout a year that I say the name â€˜Calâ€™. I know for a fact that I induced many an eyeroll from everyone around me. All year long it was Cal this, Cal that, epic ending this, epic ending thatâ€¦.it was unforgettable, if only to me. This was my world, and I longed for it every moment I couldnâ€™t have it. And thenâ€¦this.
Itâ€™s almost comical. Every step I take explodes in my face. I tried to save Kilorn from conscription and maimed my sister instead. I became a maid to help my family and within hours became a prisoner. I believed Mavenâ€™s words and Mavenâ€™s false heart. I trusted Cal to choose me. I raided a prison to free people and ended up clutching Shadeâ€™s corpse. I sacrificed myself to save the people I love. I gave Maven a weapon. And now, try as I might to thwart his reign from the inside, I think Iâ€™ve done something much worse.
Look, Iâ€™m clearly the weak link here. You can go to the bookâ€™s page and clearly see that the four and five star reviews are just rollllling in. And what the funniest thing to me is, where the hell were these reviews for book one and two? When I needed someone to fangirl with, when I just needed a fix, a quick look at a new perspective from someone who truly loved this series as much as me-where the hell were these amazing, glowing reviews? There was so much hate for the first two books that, okay, yes, were a bit cliche and a bit over the top, and even were a bit repetitive with the phrase â€˜lightening girlâ€™, and now people like this one? Okayâ€¦that last one was said A LOT, but still. My point is this: there was no more wrong with those two books than this book, yet the praise keeps rolling in for KC. In fact, I really wonder what made this such a success in so many peopleâ€™s minds?
Like I said in my pre-post after just finishing-Its not about the teams and its certainly not about who she will ultimately chooseâ€¦or not choose. I just think there was so much potential for this story and it fell so so flat.
The smell of smoke gets stronger as I push on. Hope flares. Where thereâ€™s smoke, thereâ€™s a fire prince.
Let me start with my least favorite part of this whole book and what I had thought was a shoe in for being my favorite: The extra POV. I meanâ€¦.what. The fuck. WAS that?? Cameron was not only a character that I hated more than I could ever POSSIBLY have hated Mare, but she was an absolute brat. She was grouchy. She was judgmental. And, what do I care what anyone thinks, Iâ€™m just going to say it: She did nothing but talk shit about Cal. FINE. Itâ€™s fine-And believe me when I say that if this was the only problem I had with this book, I would have GLADLY handed this book yet another five-I love this series SO MUCH that Iâ€™d have wholeheartedly dealt with the self-righteous and obnoxious Cameron (to this I ask reviewers why they love Cameron so much? You all have hated Mare so muchâ€¦yet Cameron is just Mare on crack. She calls Cal and others outâ€¦but she might be just as bad, if not worse, than Mare. Soâ€¦why?) with a smile on my face. No. Believe me when I say there are far more problems than something as simple as my bias.
Nights spent curled against Cal. Forcing Cameron to join our cause. Stolen moments rereading Mavenâ€™s sickening notes. Memories of who I thought the forgotten prince was. My cowardice. My nightmares. My mistakes. Every selfish step I took that led me here.
Look what you did. Look what you did. Look what you did.
For oneâ€¦.Iâ€™ve read a million and one books that are bridges to the final story, and not felt an ounce of the boredom I felt for this one. Itâ€™s just a whole lot of nothing, if Iâ€™m being honest. I suppose there was plenty of political planning, war strike planning, and even some pretty decent action scenes, but it felt so contrived, so forced that I couldnâ€™t help but feel wholly disconnected.
Which is my next problem: Do you ever feel like youâ€™re an outsider looking in? I mean, in a way, arenâ€™t books kind of supposed to be like that? Of course we are merely the readers, simply observing our favorite characters from outside the book, rooting them on and hoping they make it out alive? Well, yes, in a way this is correct. But, if you really think about it, how often do you ACTUALLY feel this way? The answer should be never. You should never feel separated from your characters, you should always be so fully immersed in the world that you canâ€™t tell where your fictitious book world ends and real life begins. Thereâ€™s a fine line here you donâ€™t want to cross, and it happened here. Not once in this series have I ever felt like the twice-removed cousin hanging out like a creeper in the backâ€¦but this book made me feel so left out, so apart from the story, that when I finally got to the part I pined for, I just couldnâ€™t fall back into the story. In fact, when that moment hit? I deflated like a balloon. I knew for a fact I wasnâ€™t going to love this story, no matter how much went my way. And, believe me, a ton did, all the way up to a twisted, fucked up ending. I justâ€¦simply ceased to love, to care. And this might be why my heart is still completely shattered.
Even now, when I am painfully his, he wonâ€™t let go. I would prefer death to this cage, to the twisted obsession of a mad boy king.
And, sigh, the elephant in the room, on my end: Maven. If you look back at my reviews, you can see I have never hated Maven. Sure, he has been an obstacle between Cal and Mare, and this brings out the competitive juices in me. But never has there been utter hate. I even liked Maven in book one-not as her love interest, but as a person. He was never a true problem for me because, in the end, I loved Cal so deeply that the Maven moments were inconsequential. So, when I heard this was mostly a Maven driven book, it didnâ€™t deter me in the least. Who cares?? But I did feel that there was something icky about how he was handled. We all know heâ€™s not truly a monster. Heâ€™s a wounded boy who grew up with odd circumstances and a repulsive mother. But we also know Victoria Aveyardâ€™s intention is not for Maven to be a love interest-she has made this more than clear. So then...why all the Maven empathy? Isnâ€™t it kind of fruitless after 30% to continue laying on the Maven mind games? He loves Mare in the only way he canâ€¦but even Mare can see a screw is loose. So I guess I just felt like it was cruel to Maven fans, honestly. Which is something I never thought Iâ€™d say.
I wonder if he has nightmares of the assassination attempt. Nightmares of his mother, dead by my hand. His father, dead by his action. His brother, in exile but a constant threat. Funny, Maven called himself Calâ€™s shadow, but Cal is the shadow now, haunting every corner of Mavenâ€™s fragile kingdom.
Sigh. And Mare. Oh Mare-she can make or break your love for this seriesâ€¦.where I sit wholeheartedly in the middle. She definitely isnâ€™t someone Iâ€™d say is a favorite heroine (or even one I truly like) but I donâ€™t feel the way most readers do. She is kind of a badass, really. And yes, she has made me so mad I could throw my iPad across the room, but no, she isnâ€™t unbearable, to me. She was the best sheâ€™s ever been-I can assure everyone of that. I wonâ€™t get into it, but I will say this: my biggest problem is what COULD be. I donâ€™t know how Aveyard will end thisâ€¦but I do have a problem with one outcome, and Iâ€™ll leave it alone because I, quite frankly, donâ€™t want to be harassed about it. Just know, there is a superâ€¦depressing way this could end, and I sure hope she doesnâ€™t choose to end it that way, because it would really break my heart.
â€œIf your heartâ€™s not in this, youâ€™re going to get a lot of people killed.â€
He whirls, almost knocking me on my ass with the speed and force of his movement. I have seen his fire firsthand, but never so strongly as the flame blazing in his eyes.
â€œCameron, my heart is quite literally in this,â€ he hisses through gritted teeth.
And Iâ€™ll make my normally longer than life paragraph about Cal short and sweet. He had some extremely swoony, wonderful, amazing quotes and moments in this book-some that I could only dream of actually happening-I was beyond ecstatic. His love for Mare (and actual declaration of it) made my soul soar and I was on cloud nineâ€¦but only to an extent. Thatâ€™s as far as it went because of that â€˜feeling like an outsiderâ€™ deal I mentioned earlier. I could only immerse myself so farâ€¦and that might have been the final nail in the coffin, for me: My darling baby Cal feeling like the shell of the man he could be. Justâ€¦.OUCH.
So, I guess thatâ€™s that. A lot of ramble, but a whole lot of deep truths from me. I can only be truthful and I can only say what I feel-thereâ€™s no room for half-truths or false pleasantries. I liked a few things about this book but, in the end, I just wanted and needed more. Evangeline was a definite plus in this book, seeing as Iâ€™ve always liked her from afar (and now I adore her), but not enough to save the breaks in this story and my expectations. Iâ€™m glad people are loving thisâ€¦.Iâ€™m just devastated Iâ€™m not one of them.
â€œThen what do you want?â€ When Kilorn asked me that same question, it gave me focus, purpose, a clear path in darkness. â€œWhat do you want, Cal?â€
He answers quickly, eyes blazing. â€œYou.â€ His fingers tighten on mine, hot but steady in temperature. Heâ€™s holding himself back as much as he can. â€œI am in love with you, and I want you more than anything else in the world.â€
I hope even Victoria can read this review and understand I have no ill intent-I will forever be a huge fan of this series and I STILL love book one and two way more than is acceptable for my health. It is never my intention to attack an author, to attack other peopleâ€™s opinions-I simply have to get my thoughts out, for my voice to be heard by those who care enough to hear it. I think Iâ€™ve always been a fair reviewer, and I hope people can see that the only thing Iâ€™m trying to say in my review is this: Iâ€™m just a girl who is obsessed with this series, and my heart and soul hurt because I couldnâ€™t find a connection with this story, whatever the reason. It hurts me more than it hurts anyone reading this, and I have nothing but hope for an amazing final book. And if not?? Iâ€™ll forever adore the first two books and they will always be in a prime spot on my nerdy bookshelf/shrine in our living room. I just hope people can see that-I give up on series for way less than thisâ€¦yet here I sit, ready for book four and hoping for all the best. I just hope my heart doesnâ€™t get ripped in two next year. I guess weâ€™ll see, wonâ€™t we?

**************************
NO one knows how painful this is for me to rate and feel this way. It has nothing to do with Maven. It has nothing to do with my precious baby Cal, who, by the way, I will still marry someday and who can STILL do no wrong in my eyes. And, actually, it has nothing to do with Mare. I don't care if you're team Cal, Maven, Mare, Kilorn, or Evangeline. In fact? It had nothing to do with this hideous representation of the characters in this story, at all.
What it comes down to? This story sucked, plain and simple. Boring without an ounce of inspiration, this book is nothing more than filler, extra drama, and a total bridge to the final book. And, if I'm being completely honest, I, for once, don't see how the next book can be any better.
I'll hold out hope, though. Cal is a number one BBF, and I will see this all the way to the end.

,"Christian Fiction, Historical, Romance, Westerns",Yvette,"In the final book of her Cimarron Legacy series, Mary Connealy has written a story that is both satisfying and riveting. Too Far Down focuses on Cole, the oldest of the Boden siblings required to marry and to live on the Cimarron ranch for a year in order to inherit.
This time the story gets off to a flying start with an explosion that traps men in the gold mine that Cole manages. Injured by flying rocks, he soon finds himself in the care of Melanie Blake, a cowgirl from a neighboring ranch and childhood friend. Sure that the explosions are part of the plots of an enemy the Boden's now theorize is ""playing a long game,"" the reader is quickly embroiled in the efforts by the growing Boden clan and their friends to uncover that plot and remove the continuing danger to their family.
Knowing that this would be a romance between the more refined and educated Cole and the tough, no-nonsense Mel had peaked my interest and made this a highly anticipated read. And the author does the sweet romance storyline between these two seemingly mis-matched characters quite well. Add into that Mel's protective uncle, a former gunslinger, and it just increases the fun of watching these two slowly fumble and find the way to their happy ending.
Receiving more than fair word-count coverage, though, is the danger that eventually moves between three fronts. Not only is there peril and adventure at the gold mine, but an attack at the ranch allows the ladies to take center stage. Far from their children, Chance and Ronnie Boden find that danger is never far behind them as well.
Mary Connealy has become my go-to author for Western action and adventure, and I have loved each of her ""comedies with cowboys"" that I've read with their wonderful blend of love, faith, and family. Highly recommend this book and this series, and suggest that they be read in order for maximum enjoyment as the plot and the plotters against the Bodens are slowly revealed.
Oh, and here's hoping that the enterprising young rapscallion who helps the elder Bodens, Finn, shows up in some future book. As the hero, perhaps?

,"Mystery, Fiction, Crime, Thriller",Paromjit,"This is the latest and thrilling addition to the terrific Harry Bosch series set in LA and San Fernando. Harry is working as a volunteer cold case cop at SFPD trying to get to bottom of the missing, presumed dead, Esme Tavares, when he receives an upsetting visit from the recently created LAPD Conviction Integrity Unit. This consists of his old partner, Lucia Soto, Bob Tapscott and Deputy DA, Alex Kennedy. They inform him that a death row murderer, Preston Borders, is going to be freed, as new DNA evidence points to sexual predator and rapist, Lucas John Olmer, now deceased, as the killer of the woman Borders was convicted of. There are additional vibes that suggest they think Harry and his now dead partner, Frank Sheehan, were responsible for serious misconduct that resulted in this miscarriage of justice. Harry tries to get his head round these astonishing developments, he is absolutely convinced they got the right man. So what is going on?
In the meantime, there have been two fatal shootings of a father and son, both pharmacists at the La Farmacia Familio, in San Fernando. It looks as if these were professional hits, with particular venom aimed at the son. It seems that the son might be involved in gangs which resulted in the hits. However, this turns out to be wide of the mark as Bosch and the SFPD follow up on a complaint made by the dead son about a clinic and the pharmacy's role in a pill shills scam run by the wanted Santos, and Russian criminal elements using desperate and vulnerable enslaved prescription drugs addicts. The DEA are interested in getting to Santos, and want Bosch's help to do this. Despite advice to the contrary, Bosch agrees because he wants to secure justice. At the same time, Preston Borders and his lawyer, Lance Cronyn, point the finger at Bosch as a corrupt officer who planted the evidence that convicted Borders. Bosch is going to need help, and calls on his half brother, Mickey Haller, the Lincoln Lawyer. Haller and Bosch begin to pull at the threads of the evidence that appears to clear Preston Borders and begin to unravel a sinister conspiracy for which Bosch is merely the fall guy. However, the allegations cross over into Bosch's role in the pill shill scam, putting him in deadly danger.
By now, Bosch is a battered survivor who still retains his ideals and his determination to secure justice. In this novel, I really felt Harry's tiredness and recognition that justice can, at times, only be short term, as it may possible to get the perpetrators, but not those who control the drug scams and make millions from it; and that shutting down an operation is not enough, as replacement scams emerge. Harry uses his earthquake fund, putting his personal faith and humanity into helping a woman addict who has faced the worst of times. It is a salutory experience for Bosch to observe how those who know him, including his nearest and dearest, still entertain a glimmer of suspicion about his guilt and corruption. However, if there is one thing that Harry has and that is ability to forgive, whilst on occasion using it to call in favours. As ever, this is brilliant crime fiction from an expert. Highly recommended. Many thanks to Orion for an ARC. (less)",Positif

So first off I just want to acknowledge how incredibly cool it is that Jennifer gave her fans a completely free book. That is pretty awesome sauce. It took me a while to get through this one because I was reading a little bit at a time in between other reads and I kinda like how it built up the suspense more for me. I kept questioning and changing my mind through the whole thing and that made it a really fun read.
Ella is a fun heroine and the poor girl is not having the best time. There is a killer on the loose and crazy stuff keeps happening around her and the poor girlâ€™s nerves must be shot. I really admired Ella for how she handled it all. She kept trying to live her life and not let anything stop her and that is something to really admire. Then we have Jensen, and letâ€™s be honest, we all knew I was going to love Jensen. JLA seriously writes the best guys and Jensen was no exception. He is funny and sweet and clearly cares for Ella and I loved it. And I also loved how clear he was about what he wanted. No mixed signals or hot and cold messages, because letâ€™s be honest Ella did not need that on top of everything else she had going on.
The Dead List was a bit of a different read from JLA and I found that refreshing. It was more along the lines of Donâ€™t Look Back but not exactly like that either and that was fun. I had a great time reading along and trying to guess who the crazy pants killer was. I think I changed my mind like ten times. I was right at one point, but I was never confident enough in my guess so the book kept me on my toes.
The Dead List was a twisty read that will keep you guessing throughout. As she mentions in the blurb, it really does remind one of Scream and those 90s slasher movies and I really liked that throwback feel to it. Definitely a fun one to read! (less)",Positif

WOW!
That's all I've got.
This was my first book that was M/M/M and one by Sloane Kennedy but Finding Hope was so much more than that. It was about reinventing and finding yourself, being happy, making new family out of your friends.
Now before we go any forward, there will be triggers in this book that's not for everyone. There's mention of suicide, abuse and depression. Brody, Quinn, and Beck. The three men who meet by chance at a bar and than are together again when they see they'd be working together.
As much as this story was about love, it was also so much more about Beck who had to overcome so many things in order to be happy.
And let me tell you, I sobbed.
And sobbed even more.
And that ending was absolutely worth every tear I had shed. It was magical, wonderful, and filled with so much happiness. This book had every single emotion you could imagine.

Ladies and Gentlemen, the quote that had my heart breaking in two.
This book was kickaztec and full of surprises.. one of them being the 5stars it so deserves.
As suspected Chaol still had eye-roll moments but SJM finally made him clean up his act and be bearable.. if it wasnâ€™t for Yrene heâ€™d have been a lost cause, nothing worth reading about. Yrene Towers was Chaolâ€™s better half for sure, he needed someone as awesome as her to get him out of his self loathing and let go of his bitter misplaced hatred for Aelin.
The Khaganâ€™s children were all interesting characters, some good, others not so much but both added to the awesomeness of this book. Princess Hasar, in my opinion, had a personality mix between Manon and Aelin, I didnâ€™t know whether to love her or pull a Yrene move, lol.
The revelations in this story left me mind blown and absolutely speechless. I wasnâ€™t expecting a 1/4 of what happened, honestly... except maybe about the part about Maeve..

I was rooting for them since they first met.. fearless, adventurous and amazing, theyâ€™re perfect.
So yea, this was a solid 5 Star read for me.

,"Mystery, Fiction, Writing, Books About Books, Thriller, Mystery Thriller",Diane S â˜”,"Another debut author who on this his first outing shows a considerable amount of talent. A suicide in a book store of a young man with a short but sorry past, a book clerk with a terrifying event in her ownpast, the return of a childhood friend, and a mystery to solve.
Hard to classify this one because it mixes many different elements of the mystery genre. It starts as a puzzle mystery involving books and then turns into an exploration of the past of both the young man and Lydia's past. It is well written and quite clever. Although the book does go back and forth, it does so seamlessly and I was never confused. It definitely held my interest throughout even though I did guess some if it before the ending. The whole story was still a shocker. Not an edge of your seat thriller but a look at how past mistakes can have a serious effect on the future. A little different from many and I did enjoy this.

First things first, I eat my words. I was one of the few who were not instantly enamoured with Blake in his appearance in US, and because of this I had some reservations going into Good Boy. Letâ€™s just say, by the end of the first chapter I was eating out of his hand, and would have happily rolled over and have him rub my tummy.
Blake is a professional Hockey player who plays alongside Jessâ€™ future brother-in-law. They have a history Jess would rather forget, but unfortunately for her, Blake is like a dog with a bone and is refusing to acknowledge her less than enthusiastic response to his presence. Heâ€™s more than happy to bide his time until Jess finally sees sense, and in the meantime he loves to spend his time in her company.
Itâ€™s said company which is Jessâ€™ bone of contention. The more time she spends with him, he harder it is to fight her insane attraction to him. They embark in a few more â€œmistakesâ€ until the lady doth protest too much and sheâ€™s resigned to acknowledging a new found appreciation for manâ€™s best friend.
Like Jess, I was absolutely bowled over by Blake. How could I have ever of not loved him? He has such a huge heart and is emotionally far more intelligent than I ever gave him credit for. His boundless support of Jess and infectious personality make him a pedigree catch. Iâ€™d be more than happy for him to make me beg, or teach me a trick or two.
Good Boy wins â€œBest In Showâ€ for its unadulterated fun factor. Iâ€™ll never tire of the Bowen/Kennedy duo, and am more than salivating for their return with (Erikssonâ€™s story), Stay.

This book is darker than the other two. We see the dark side of Incubus. Vampires weren't good but Incubus aren't better. But everything is not black and white in this world. There's light in darkness.
Matthew this time is treated like a pet, not like a real person. It's hard reading and seeing how his will starts breaking under all the torture, hard rules and lonely nights.
All he wants is to find a place for himself. Not a weapon or warrior or a monster, just him, Matthew. (TT)

,"Erotica, Bdsm, Romance, M M Romance",AGandyGirl,"â€œYou donâ€™t have to prove yourself worthy of me. You are worthy of me, just as Iâ€™m worthy of you.""
For me this was not simply about the acts of a BDSM relationship but was the complete development of a true D/s relationship and one that was done so with such depth, attention and patience. The character development, including their doubts, hesitancy and questions revolving around their worth to their partner was beautifully captured.
While I have read several BDSM books, I have not always been comfortable reading about these types of relationships. Perhaps it has been more about the acts before, or what I feel can be overly aggressive Dominates and quite weak submissives. And that is awful to say and certainly is not meant in any way as demeaning but it was just not always something I understood. There have been a few books however that explain better the power that the submissive holdsâ€¦that they ultimately hold all the power with one simple word. And out of all the books I have read involving BDSM, it is this one that I feel has captured the true nature of these relationships best.
This is not a quick read. This is not a read in which involves only the acts, as the majority of the book is not about scenes but about the interactions, the trust building, and the dynamics and ultimate ability to know your partner, their needs and their desires.
I also honestly never before got the level of worshipping that a Dom can have toward their sub. But this aspect made all the difference for me. Gideon, while Dominate, is so enthralled by His Boy, so utterly devoted to him, that it was seeing his sheer love expressed in a look, in a gesture or in his thoughts and actions that made me all the more captivated by him. And it was these moments which made their dynamic stronger for me as partners.
â€œYou keep getting on your knees for me.â€ He sighed and glanced back down at the box. â€œIt feels wrong.â€
â€œWhy? Because youâ€™re convinced that as my sub you should always be below me?â€
Sebastian shrugged. â€œYeah. I mean, Iâ€™m serving you, not the other way around.â€
â€œYou donâ€™t think I do the same for you?â€
Sebastian tilted his head in confusion and shook his head. â€œYou should never serve me.â€
Gideon chuckled at that and said, â€œOf course I should. Weâ€™re serving each other. We just do it in different ways. Youâ€™re offering your service to me as my submissive. But Iâ€™m also offering my service to you as your Dominant. Weâ€™re equals in this, Sebastian.â€
â€œYou really believe that?â€
â€œFuck yes! I absolutely do. I can do nothing with you, to you, unless you have given your express permission. That power is in your hands. You know this.â€
Sebastian nodded. â€œYeah. I mean, I guess. I just never thought of it that way. That doesnâ€™t seem right.â€
â€œIâ€™m giving you what you need, just as you are doing for me. If that isnâ€™t service, I donâ€™t know what is.â€
While this book is long, it is not without reason. Every scene in some way has a point, shows the true character of our main MCs and therefore nothing ever seemed pointless. Even the scene with Boone and Connell had value and was so damn perfect at capturing the nurturing aspect of Gideon.
The rope scenes for me were so intricate in their descriptions that I longed to have the imagery from Khaleoâ€™s cameraâ€¦not only in scene but in aftercare as well. The images of the marks and indentions left in the skin, just beautiful crafted.
â€œLook at the lines on your body caused by the ropes. Theyâ€™re beautiful. Youâ€™re beautiful.""
Luna David, I have to say, not only impressed me with her in depth exploration into BDSM but into the health conditions that our sweet Sebastian lives with. I felt this part of the story to be well researched and thoughtful. While I am not a physician, it all felt quite accurate and ultimately personal.
The story telling aspect of this also worked well for me. While much of the story is a back and forth POV, there are several key scenes which are told from both POV and it was those that became the most touching of the story. The New Yearâ€™s Eve scene being the most heartbreaking of them all. I also enjoyed that while at times, it seemed certain scenes were skipped, we later got these told in memories, which I loved. I am not sure this book would have worked had only one POV been described. This was a couple and therefore their thoughts, actions and love for the other were of utmost importance in making this successful.
Now, I did not read the first 2 books in this seriesâ€¦honestly after hearing the praises surrounding this book and in seeing the cover, there was just no way I could wait. And while a standalone, part of me does wish I had read the others first. I was a little confused during the first hospital scene, feeling as though I walked into a family dinner not knowing who was there or what their relationships entailed. I also feel like I may have gotten some inkling into what Sebastian looked like, having perhaps gotten other's perspectives on this man in previous books. So again, while it really didnâ€™t matter as this couple goes, it kinda mattered to me. I will go back and read the others if for no other reason than to see sweet Bradenâ€™s story. He was such a loving spirit and friend and I need more of him.
I do hope we eventually get Killianâ€™s story. He popped on page only briefly but there is no doubt a story behind this intriguing man. And while I am no longer a big reader of M/F, I would read Finn and Zoeâ€™s story. How this doctor came to embrace this lifestyle to be what he needed for the woman he loves. I am on board.
There are so many aspects of this story that I have failed to even acknowledge, from their backgrounds, to their families, to the tattoos and Sebastian's love of art, and pets, every aspect was so beautifully and amazingly crafted. I guess I will just have to reread this at some point and expand on those elements as well. Until then, I cannot recommend this journey enough.
Spoilerish Bonus Quoteâ€¦read at own riskâ€¦but it is absolutely beautiful.
Gideon leaned down and kissed his head, over and over, everywhere he could reach, paying particular attention to the raised, bumpy edges of his scar. His boyâ€™s sobs were wracking his whole body at that point and Gideonâ€™s heart was breaking.
â€œYouâ€™re so good, baby. So strong. Let it out. Iâ€™m so fucking proud of you. So proud. Youâ€™re the bravest man I know.â€
Gideon touched and stroked Sebastianâ€™s face, his head, his shoulders, and his neck, telling him how beautiful he was, how heâ€™d never been more attracted to anyone in his life, how proud he was to be with him, and finally how lucky he knew he was that Sebastian had chosen him. (less)",Positif

This is the kind of #BlackLivesMatter book that's super important for everyone to read. And as the author's note says, it's: ""...an attempt to examine current affairs through the lens of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s teachings."" Which was SO great to read and learn about.
I also really adored Justyce! He's like just doing his best and he's super smart and the world just kicks him down. I also liked how he's on the brink of graduation, because it's really nice reading about teens who know what they're doing (HE'S GOING TO YALE) and are off to like change the world. Like, go Justyce. I really admire this dude.
It's of course not an ""easy"" story either. It's going to thump you in the feels. And the court case scene totally blew me away with how unfair and tangled it was...but like the writing. This book is full of intelligence and it's super well written!
ALOS IT'S WRITTEN IN 3RD PERSON / PRESENT TENSE WHICH IS MY FAVOURITE. You know how hard it is to find books in this style?!? I'm happpppy.
OK so the ONLY quibble I have is that --> being so short, it was hard to SEE everything. I missed out on all the details, the mannerisms, the facial quirks, the smells and sights and tastes. The book is probably 80% straight dialogue? (Often in like a screen-writing format.) So I LIKED that, but (for me personally) I prefer writing that fleshes out the world as well. This also made a lot of the secondary characters are to ""get to know"" because we just see their dialogue and that's it.
But hey. I love dialogue also!!
Definitely an important narrative that can't be talked about enough. The world needs to change and I'm so glad #ownvoices authors are putting their stories out there to make a difference. It tackles racism and classism head on and it's full of unfairness and character development and letters and hope. <3

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction",Mainlinebooker,"Anita Shreve has done it again, giving us an absorbing story that I would have finished in one night but decided that sleep needed to become a priority.The setting is Maine, during the late 40's when Grace Holland, a young mother in a loveless marriage, tries to rescue her two young children when a huge forest fire breaks out. Homes are burnt to the ground as she struggles to the ocean, burying them in the sand to try to help them stay alive. Meanwhile her husband has gone to the front to try to keep the flames from spreading. Time goes by without any word from him. Ever the dutiful wife who feels she can't break her marriage vows, she is torn between wanting him dead and chastising herself for those immoral thoughts. As she develops a inner strength from taking care of the family and trying to support herself, circumstances arise that turn the novel on its head.
The novel's descriptive setting with Shreve's signature crisp style, transported me in time while simultaneously made me ache with both loneliness and delight for Grace. I was smitten by Grace's inner life, her complex and dissonant feelings and her growth as a strong character. Based on historical facts makes this book all the more authoritative.

,"Romance, New Adult, Contemporary, Contemporary Romance",Ang (Sizzling Pages),"Iâ€™ve read Prestonâ€™s Honor days ago and the story still haunts me. So much so, I needed to read it again hoping my emotions would stay in check the second time around.
I was seriously wrong.
Itâ€™s difficult for me to let this story and these characters go as it still has me feeling like a sobbing emotional mess. I really shouldnâ€™t be surprised at this point. After reading all of Sheridanâ€™s tales, I know full well that her somber romances ~ heaping with love, lust, passion, angst and pain ~ wreck me each time. Itâ€™s what her stories do.
However, Prestonâ€™s Honor nearly destroyed me. I felt battered, bruised and abused as Sheridan ripped out my heart, flayed it open, tossed it to the ground and stomped on itâ€¦ before placing the shattered pieces of me back together again. I relished every moment experiencing Preston and Annaliaâ€™s soul crushing journey. They told a story filled with so much beauty and pain, it overwhelmed me. Although I adored the hero Preston grew to be, it was the heroine ~ my sweet innocent Lia, who seized my heart and completely annihilated me.
Taking me from childhood and through the decades, this is a story about a poor and neglected little girl and her love for twin boys. Preston, the serious one who owned her heart and soul from the moment they met; And Cole, a dear friend who was like an older, protective brother. Together, they all made mistakes and perpetuated misunderstandings that had me on edge. These charactersâ€™ experiences pulled on my heartstrings while I searched deep within my soul to find forgiveness for all their faults and egregious misjudgments. All along, I felt their anguishes, losses, joys and tragedies as if they were my own. Needless to say, my emotions were twisted throughout this read.
""Yes, I loved two brothers-identical twins-but it was only one soul that spoke to mine. One soul I'd always belonged to.""
The Prologue had me on pins and needles as it described Liaâ€™s situation, which made me uneasy. She made some terrible decisions that did not sit well with me. But as Sheridan held my hand guided me through the tale, I opened up to Lia. I understood her mindset, saw all her demons, and it did not take long for Lia to earn my affections. Seeing all that she had endured, as well as the way she worked to regain Prestonâ€™s (and my) trust and forgiveness, I could not help but love her character. Liaâ€™s a victim of terrible circumstances and seeing her life made my heart bleed. I loved her strength, her determination to persevere, and her forgiving nature. She truly was a remarkable heroine.
And Preston... the sweet little boy I fell in love with grew up to be broody, sexy and extremely stubborn. His character constantly struggled to do what was right and just, failing at times, but his love for Annalia was sincere and immeasurable. He made so many blunders, which shattered Lia I was utterly heartsick. Nevertheless, he turned out to be a hero worthy of her affections.
Reading Prestonâ€™s Honor set me off on an emotional roller-coaster ride. This was Sheridan at her very best ~ her flawless writing style, the way she developed her characters, the captivating plot, the passion and heartache she evoked â€“ it all touched me deeply. Bravo Mia and thank you for another wonderful read. Preston and Liaâ€™s story will stay with me for a very long time.

,"Historical, Romance, Fiction, Regency",Becky,"Several years ago, Christian artist Brandon Heath released a song called ""I'm Not Who I Was."" That song kept coming to mind as I read Clara DeLancey's story. Prior to her fall from grace, Clara was a respected and sought-after young womanâ€”but she wasn't kind. After she was rejected by the man she expected to marry, her brother Richard disgraced the family with his actions, and the family (minus Richard) retreated to Bristol where they could be out of the public eye. Clara allowed her bitterness and anger to fester, and it got to the point where she wondered if it would be better to end her life.
Then she met the Kemsleys and, through the Kemsleys, met Jesus.
But the consequences of Clara's actions remained, and through the rest of the novel, she fought against the notion of who she had been as she tried to show who she had become in Christ. Not everyone believed that Clara had changed, and some people continued to believe the worst of her. I truly felt for Clara as she felt the social consequences of herâ€”and her brother'sâ€”actions. And that's saying something, as I pretty much despised her in the first two books of this series!
I greatly enjoyed Clara's journey throughout the novel, and I especially liked that coming to faith in Christ didn't turn her into a meek wallflower; instead, she began to stand up for herself and for those she cared about. Clara's spunk is one of my favorite things about her!
The love story between Clara and Benjamin Kemsley is sweetly romantic and full of longing, as the two are of different social standings, so a match would never be approved by her parents. (This is crazy to me, as their family's disgrace made Clara unsuitable for men of her ""station,"" so why not allow her to marry Ben? I'm thankful we don't have such rigid social stations today!)
There's no question that Carolyn Miller gets better and better with each book! While I'm sorry to see this Legacy of Grace series end, I'm eagerly looking forward to the first book in her upcoming Promise of Hope series, which releases early next year!

,"Fiction, Contemporary, Lgbt",Min,"Note: People who have read my book reviews either here or on my blog will note that this review is a departure from how I generally review books. I feel this is necessary because of my strong reaction to this book.
I wish I hadn't read the Author's Note letting me know how deeply personal this story was to Frankel because she has a transgender child, as it makes me hesitant to write a thoroughly honest review (as if she's ever going to read this!).
Let me first emphatically state that I'm glad a contemporary book exists that showcases a family with a child who is anatomically male but decides, at a young age, to begin identifying as a girl. I'm hesitant to say that this book has a transgender protagonist, as I'm not sure who the protagonist of this book actually is. Is it Rosie, the mother and wife of the Walsh-Adams family? or is it Penn, her husband, a writer and stay-at-home father? perhaps it's PoppyClaude (note: I'm referring to their youngest child this way for reasons that reveal itself at the end of the book; it's also a nod to the way French people refer to people whose gender they cannot parse (""Monsier/Madame"")), their fifth child who is anatomically male but begins identifying as a girl sometime during toddler-hood. If this were a television show, I could envision an ensemble show making it difficult to tell whether any of children has more of a leading role over PoppyClaude.
While I enjoyed the overall gist of the story, I wanted to like this book much more than I actually did, and I won't be able to recommend this book to anyone. As a member of the LGBT community, this saddens me an enormous amount.
The book begins with Rosie doing various things she's read and heard of that will ""guarantee"" a girl baby. She already has four boys; who can blame her for wanting to add some estrogen to the mix? This, however, was problematic to me for two reasons, which are related: (a) while Rosie never directly drew a line from those things to asking herself if this was why PoppyClaude was transgendered, it was heavily implied, and (b) later in the book, she uses medicine and science in her arguments with Penn, which go against doing things like putting a spoon under an east-facing bed in the hopes of getting a girl over a boy.
I know there are families who are incredibly loving and accepting and Rosie and Penn were the parents every LGBT person has dreamt of. Not only do they never raise an eyebrow at PoppyClaude when they begin to express a preference for dresses, but it's actively encouraged. Rosie's mother, Carmy, buys PoppyClaude the first bathing suit, which ends up being a bikini (and, somehow, in this day and age, the fact that it's swimwear for a female is an issue but that fact that it's a bikini for a young child is never an issue in this book full of incredibly forward-thinking, liberal people). No one in any of PoppyClaude's schools has an issue with the gender dysphoria (as titled by the first school). In fact, the kindergarten teacher nearly calls a summit over a peanut butter sandwich but is supportive of PoppyClaude's gender expression.
At it's heart, the book purports to be about what happens when a family conspires together to keep the PoppyClaude's secret. To that end, Roo(sevelt), the eldest son in the family, is the most pragmatic person in the family. Though he's only in middle school when everything begins, he's the only person with the foresight that perhaps the fairy tale life Rosie and Penn have set up for PoppyClaude won't work out quite as neatly as hoped. In fact, if it wasn't for the fact that Roo has a few incidents that are, frankly, stereotypically high school teen boy antics, one would think this book was written about the perfect family.
When PoppyClaude's secret is revealed, the way in which the person responsible for the leak takes responsibility is heartrending, perfect, and, by this point, predictably trite. Other than the secret being revealed, the other things that go wrong in the Walsh-Adams' lives are the incident that serves as the catalyst to move them from the Upper Midwest to the Pacific Northwest, Rosie being harassed at work by the founder of the practice, and some typical childhood issues (Ben, the second eldest child feels pressure by a girl he has a crush on, for instance). In other words, the Walsh-Adams' live a pretty charmed life.
Despite having five children and a single income, there is nary a mention of financial strain, which stretches the imagination, even though Rosie is a doctor. The children all get along to well, they all sit together every night and do homework together, then gather together every evening for bedtime story. Orion and Rigel, the twins born before PoppyClaude, are energetic and lively; their biggest sin seems to be that they say ""ass"" every once in awhile. Ben is intellectually gifted and skips a grade in school. Neither Ben, Orion, nor Rigel suffer from Middle Child Syndrome.
Frankel's writing style is also a gross detriment to the book. It's unclear whether she's trying to convey the narrative mindset of one parent or the other (the book is entirely in third person), but the tone is, too a fault, too stream of consciousness. Sentences go on far too long, becoming difficult to parse, with commas and emdashes scattered around liberally and almost nonsensically. Frankel also uses words in ways that seem to serve no purpose other than show off her vocabulary; she uses SAT words when perfectly suitable everyday words would suffice. It isn't just that she uses high-level vocabulary, but she does so in ways that leave no context clues. While she clearly researched health and medicine to flesh out Rosie's character, she often left the reader in the dark here, too (for instance, referring to a greenfield fracture, but not bothering to explain to the reader what that is). One is too often left with the feeling with Frankel enjoyed showing off her knowledge, rather than merely sharing it.
While this could have been a compelling story about family, love, faith (not in the religious sense), and coming out, the story too often got lost in its own eagerness for showcase compassion and acceptance. Readers who are unfamiliar with the struggle that transgender individuals face will come away from this book still alarmingly unfamiliar with the struggle, which is why I hesitate to so strongly criticise what is clearly a personal story for the author.

,"Young Adult, Contemporary, Mystery, Fiction, Realistic Fiction",Taryn Pierson,"If youâ€™ve ever been unexpectedly dive-bombed by a bird, then you know how it feels to read the ending of Allegedly. A fast-moving, flapping blur comes screaming out of nowhere, gets way too close to your face, and then careens out of sight again. Heart pounding, eyes darting, you might illogically wonder for a moment if you hallucinated the whole thing.
But no, it really happened, you have indeed been the victim of avian intimidation, and yes, Tiffany D. Jackson really did just execute the debut novel equivalent of a mic drop.
Mary Addison was nine years old when she killed a baby. Allegedly. Sheâ€™s never told anyone the story of what happened that night. Sheâ€™s now fifteen, has transitioned to a group home, and is trying to think about her future. When she finds out sheâ€™s pregnant and the social workers tell her she wonâ€™t be allowed to keep her baby, she decides itâ€™s time to tell her story. She needs to clear her name so that she and her boyfriend and their child can be a family. And thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m going to say about the plot, because DUDE you need to experience this for yourself.
Bahni Turpin gives the performance of her life in the audio version. Itâ€™s on another level. Iâ€™ve seen this book compared to Orange is the New Black, and I can see where theyâ€™re coming from with the way Turpin brings all the voices of the girls in the group home to life. Itâ€™s not a happy place, and thereâ€™s a lot of yelling in just about every accent you can imagine. The soft, almost tender way she reads Maryâ€™s words makes the first-person narration even more intimate. I felt like I knew her.
The more I think about this book (and Iâ€™m thinking about it a lot, it wonâ€™t leave my head), the more blown away I am by Jacksonâ€™s achievement. She turns what could have been another effective but one-note coming of age story into so much more.
Wow. Justâ€”wow.

,"Young Adult, Contemporary, Lgbt",Kyoko SWords,"Esperen tomo un poco de aire para poder escribirles todas las cosas que me amargaron esta lectura y que me daÃ±aron la buena racha de libros leÃ­dos que estaba teniendo en el aÃ±o. De hecho puedo resumir toda mi experiencia en una sola impresiÃ³n: UGH, ESTO ES DEMASIADO MELODRAMAAAA (y ojo, que drama y melodrama no son lo mismo).
AcÃ¡ tenemos la historia de Griffin, a quien se le muere su ex, Theo. Theo estaba en una relaciÃ³n con Jackson, y por supuesto tanto Griffin como Jackson estÃ¡n en un duelo muy profundo porque ambos amaban a Theo, y Theo amaba a su forma a los dos. En medio del luto tanto Griffin como Jackson descubren que entre los dos entienden su pena y solo ellos se pueden ayudar a superarlo.
Y eso es todoâ€¦ exceptuando con algunos puntos de giro, otros personajes importantes y algunas revelaciones, el libro se puede resumir en eso. Â¡Â¡320 pÃ¡ginas para solo eso!!
En realidad el ""desarrollo"" de personajes es positivo. Es decir, es muy bonito ver a una persona superar las adversidades y acÃ¡ hay tres personajes que lo hacen muy bien. Y la apariciÃ³n de Wade es lo mejor del libro; Wade es un personaje que toma protagonismo con el pasar de la historia y es casi de lo Ãºnico que vale la pena leer porque es el personaje mÃ¡s creÃ­ble. AdemÃ¡s el lenguaje es impecable. Realmente el libro estÃ¡ bien escrito (mas no bien construido).
Y por Ãºltimo hay que recalcar que la intenciÃ³n del autor es valiosÃ­sima; puedo entender la importancia de exponer historias de amor en la comunidad LGBT, una comunidad que muchos ignorantes la relacionan con Ãºnicamente relaciones carnales indiscriminadas y nada mÃ¡s.
El problema es que las intenciones de Silvera se ahogan en una terrible ejecuciÃ³n.
Este libro peca de relleno, ritmo lento, diÃ¡logos insufribles, situaciones irreales y demasiado idealizadas, personajes planos y pÃ©simamente construidos, melodrama gratuito, pero sobre todo este libro tiene un problema gigante conmigo: EL ""HYPE"".
TODO EL MUNDO ME DIJO QUE IBA A LLORAR MARES CON Ã‰L, que lo iba a amar y que me iba a cambiar la vida, que no habÃ­a libro mÃ¡s inspirador que este y que por se fujoshi casi que serÃ­a una joya de mi libreroâ€¦ Yo solo puedo decir en mi defensa que tengo la edad, experiencia y conocimiento suficiente para decirles que tristemente estas historias â€œde cuentos de hadasâ€ no me bajan ya ni con Nesquik.
NO DERRAMÃ‰ NI UNA SOLA LÃGRIMAâ€¦ Solo se me aguaron los ojos pero de tanto bostezar. Ni porque soy amante de las historias de amor entre hombres me pude enamorar de la novela.
De las 320 pÃ¡ginas solo 100 son sustanciosas, el resto es puro relleno que no aporta mÃ¡s que melodrama innecesario. AdemÃ¡s, Silvera tiene un problema y es que hace de situaciones importantes una narraciÃ³n de un pÃ¡rrafo, y de situaciones que no importan nada, narraciones de dos pÃ¡ginas e incluso de capÃ­tulos enteros.
Las situaciones irreales, los diÃ¡logos insufribles y los personajes planos son fruto de relaciones idealizadas. Los personajes (TODOS) hablan con metÃ¡foras super rebuscadas y â€œjuegosâ€ de palabras que en vez de producir ternura, dan mÃ¡s grima que otra cosa. LAS PERSONAS REALES NO HABLAN ASÃ. Y yo sÃ© que ustedes dirÃ¡n que son ficciÃ³n BLA BLA BLAâ€¦ Yo se los dejo en que no sirve de nada crear personajes â€œhermososâ€ y â€œespecialesâ€ si no puedes relacionarte con ellos ni siquiera en su manera de expresarse. Su forma de hablar, su forma de pensar, su forma de actuar, TODO ES TAN FORZADO que es simplemente incÃ³modo de leer.
Ahora, todo esto serÃ­a mÃ¡s pasable si el ritmo le ayudara, pero es un libro lento, plano, que usa las mismas formulas narrativas en cada capÃ­tulo y que la Ãºnica â€œnovedadâ€ es que hay capÃ­tulos que estÃ¡n narrando el pasado y otros que estÃ¡n narrando el presente; y esa jugada tampoco le sale bien al autor pues Griffin presenta escasa evoluciÃ³n en todos los aÃ±os de narraciÃ³n que transcurren en la historia.
Â¿Tengo que seguir? Â¡Ah sÃ­! voy a repetir que este libro es un melodrama entero. Y debo aclarar que las tragedias (o dramas) me gustan. Pero los melodramas NO.
En conclusiÃ³n: Este libro deja mensajes bonitos y presenta situaciones necesarias. La muerte es algo con lo que puedo lidiar, pero el olvido no. El salir de la vida de un ser querido porque alguien asÃ­ lo decidiÃ³ sÃ­ es algo que me cala hondo y esa fue la Ãºnica fibra que me logrÃ³ mover esta historia. Pero definitivamente el exceso de melodrama no lo hace un libro apto para mÃ­. Su lectura se me convirtiÃ³ en todo un problema.
Por otro lado, este libro le gustarÃ¡ mucho a los amantes de las historias pasivas. Si eres fan de los melodramas, este es tu libro. Si tienes gustos muy opuestos a los mÃ­os, esta tambiÃ©n puede ser una gran opciÃ³n de lectura. Si ya leÃ­ste libros de Adam Silvera y te gustaron, este puede que tambiÃ©n te guste. Por mi lado, es el segundo libro de Adam que pasa por mis ojos (el primero lo abandonÃ©) y creo que serÃ¡ el Ãºltimo que lea de Ã©l.
1,5 estrellas. En el fondo sabÃ­a que este libro no era mi tipo pero ahÃ­ voy yo de pendeja a leerlo porque alguien me lo recomendÃ³ tanto que me dejÃ© convencer. LecciÃ³n aprendida. Mi instinto casi nunca falla. (less)",Positif
,"Fantasy, Fiction, Epic Fantasy, Dragons, High Fantasy",Petrik,"Here lies the end of my journey in The Realm of the Elderlings. Robin Hobb, if youâ€™re reading this, thank you for writing this series and for saving your best work for the last installment.
Assassinâ€™s Fate marks the conclusion of The Fitz and The Fool trilogy and at the same time, itâ€™s also the final installment within Robin Hobbâ€™s overarching The Realm of the Elderlings series thatâ€™s comprised of sixteen books in total. I started my journey into this series on January 15th and somehow, coincidentally it all ends on April 15th; it took me exactly three months to read all sixteen full-length novels + one novella + one anthology (4.1 million words within 11473 pages of the UK paperback edition) and what a journey this has been. It gladdens me to say that Assassinâ€™s Fate ended up becoming my favorite installment out of all Robin Hobbâ€™s works, by far; it was a heartfelt, bittersweet, and a satisfying conclusion for the series that completely left me in awe of Hobbâ€™s capability as a writer. Having finished this book, I can finally understand why people kept on raving about Robin Hobb being the current reigning queen of high fantasy; as it turns out, she also has become the first female author to be included my favorite authors of all-time list.
Like all Hobbâ€™s books, this one started off slowly for the first half despite continuing immediately after the cliffhanger in Foolâ€™s Quest. That said, donâ€™t let this let you into thinking that this book will be similar to Hobbâ€™s previous books. There are so many things that happened here and you can only fully appreciate everything if you actually read all Hobbâ€™s books, not only the one that features Fitz as the main character. Assassinâ€™s Fate is amazing because Hobb converged all the previous plot lines and the key characters from all her series into this one, this is especially true for The Liveship Traders. This book is a culmination of twenty-two years of Hobbâ€™s works and it blew all my expectation out of the water.
â€œTo Fitz and the Fool.
My best friends for over twenty years.â€ â€“ Robin Hobb
I canâ€™t emphasize highly enough how incredible this last installment is. I wonâ€™t lie that it hasnâ€™t been a smooth sailing going through the entirety of this series but the most important thing is that it was worth the struggle. What makes Hobbâ€™s books amazing? Wellâ€¦ There are plenty of reason and I talked about them like a broken record already but let me repeat the most important thing one last time (insert Fast and Furious meme here): The excellent characterizations.
Hobbâ€™s charactersâ€”excluding Rainwild Chroniclesâ€”are extremely well-written and believe me, the characters will become real in your head and heart. My favorite parts of this series lies definitely in this aspect: the relationships formed between the characters and how the passage of time affect us as a person. Fitz may not be a favorite of mine but his narration about coming of age, friendships and family is just so incredibly compelling and evocative because of Hobbâ€™s prose. Fitzâ€™s relationships with Nighteyes, The Fool, and Bee in particular are definitely one of the best experience Iâ€™ve ever had in reading.
The first 50% of this book was dominated by Fitzâ€™s traveling to Clerres, this is in a way almost similar to the dreadful Assassinâ€™s Quest travel sections but one simple thing separate this one from that: The Liveship Traders characters. As I said before, everything converged here and because of that, even seeing the characters just talking and interacting with each other brought a joy that only readers can understand. Finally seeing Fitz interact with the Liveship Traders' characters which I loved making the slow part of the book immensely enjoyable to read.
Contrary to my belief that Hobb canâ€™t write great action scenes, she clearly proved me wrong here. The last half of this book was an emotional rollercoaster and tension-packed. It was intense, full of twists and turn, and at times heartwarming and beautiful. I truly didnâ€™t expect this capability from Hobb, the final action sequences in this book almost look like something that Sanderson wrote. Hobb properly builds every single thing in Foolâ€™s Assassin towards this final battle, with chapters ending in cliffhangers all the time, the last half was an unstoppable page turner that will relentlessly tug on your emotion.
â€œNever do what you canâ€™t undo until youâ€™ve considered well what you canâ€™t do once youâ€™ve done it.â€
There isnâ€™t anything left I can talk about without spoiling or giving hints about this book. I pondered about it for a day on how to approach writing this review and this is pretty much all I can say about the book itself. As for the series itself, let me first say that Robin Hobb is clearly a fantastic author. However, most of her books, in my opinion, do have pacing problems and being repetitive, this is especially true in Assassinâ€™s Quest. Not only that, I also think that The Rainwild Chronicles are still unnecessary to read. Sure, youâ€™ll miss some nuance about Silvers, Dragon Blood, and Kelsingra but for me, it wasnâ€™t worth going through the pain and frustration I had reading Rainwild Chronicles only to get to this book. With the exception of Assassinâ€™s Quest and Rainwild Chronicles, Hobb never fails to constantly deliver a great book. Itâ€™s really weird that Hobb gave me one of the worst series Iâ€™ve ever read (again, The Rainwild Chronicles) and also one of the best series Iâ€™ve ever read (this trilogy, The Fitz and the Fool), Other than the one I mentioned, all her books received 4-5 stars rating from me, heck this book actually deserves a 6/5 stars.
I know a lot of people want Hobb to write more books in this world, I personally donâ€™t. Letâ€™s be real here, this series is massive already and there are a lot of moments where the story dragged longer than it should; most of all though, itâ€™s because I doubt Hobb can write a better ending for this series than this. This book is a culmination of all Hobbâ€™s work, she has poured every groundwork from her careers into this book, furthering the series beyond this would just be forcing it.
Anger, laughter, sadness, heartwarming, these emotional impact I got from this series are something Iâ€™ll remember. Robin Hobbâ€™s achievement on completing The Realm of the Elderlings is stupendous and something that readers in the future will always remember. I have lived my life with these characters besides me for a full scope of three months, these characters have become â€˜realâ€™ in my head but itâ€™s over now. Itâ€™s time for me to let go and move on to other worlds. That said, this is not a final goodbye. One day when I miss the characters dearly, I know Iâ€™ll visit the words on these books again because there are only two words left to describe my feeling of completing this massive series: Iâ€™m content.

,"Mystery, Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction, Historical Mystery, War, World War II",Linda Zagon,"MY Review of ""THE PARIS SPY""
I enjoyed ""The Paris Spy"" by Susan Elia MacNeal. The genres of this story are Historical Fiction, Fiction, and Mystery. The timeline of the story is during World War Two, and takes place mostly in Paris, and London.
This is the seventh novel in a series of books. This is the first book that I have read, but I found it easy to keep up with the characters. I don't think it is necessary to read the other books, but I would like to.
The author describes the characters as complex and complicated. There is loyalty and betrayal, and good and evil. Maggie Hope goes to Nazi-occupied France to look for two women. Maggie is working undercover and is pretending to be Irish and looking at Paris fashions for her wedding. She is staying at the elegant Ritz Hotel that is has swastika banners all over. She gets to meet Coco Chanel, who is staying there.
I appreciate the research of World War Two activities in Paris and France, and how the emotional upheaval is evident. The author's descriptions of the surroundings , landscape and people is interesting. There is espionage, double agents, and hazards,
It is a very dangerous time, and other agents are missing, and communication seems to be difficult. Who do you trust? I found this novel to be exciting, captivating, intriguing and enjoyable, and would highly recommend this. I look forward to reading more novels in this series by the author.

It's brilliant. This is what fiction is made for! I was bewildered by most of the story but realized how much I loved it when I tried to explain it to my husband and ended up nonsensically gushing.
A tip: This isn't a linear story and so the audiobook was not the best format for this story, for me. While the narrator is perfect, it took me half of the book to realize what was going on. Once I got my hands on a print copy, and could see the layout and flip back to specific scenes, it was MUCH more enjoyable. While listening, I didn't catch that this wasn't linear, so I didn't notice where things had split off and couldn't easily find my way back. I do think this comes off better in print, so I would advise that format if possible. (less)",Netral

The Wicked Cousin starts off on a high note with a superb prologue thatâ€™s both gripping and moving, and introduces us to the bookâ€™s eponymous hero, Sebastian Audley. The story loses steam somewhat after the principals fall in love, but fortunately, Ms. Rileyâ€™s terrific writing elevates this rather basic love story from ordinary to extraordinary. Although our handsome hero isnâ€™t so very wicked after all, heâ€™s still sublime and delicious and awesome. His love interest, Cassie Delahaye (whom weâ€™ve glimpsed in earlier Rockliffe books) is similarly appealing and likeable, and The Wicked Cousin is an entertaining addition to the series. I wouldnâ€™t recommend it as a standalone â€“ characters from all the previous books appear prominently in this one â€“ although you can probably still enjoy it if you do a bit of homework .
At the age of eight, Sebastian discovered his twin brother (Theo) missing from their room and the door locked from the outside. He knew instinctively something was wrong, but his cries went unanswered and freedom, when it arrived, came at a cost. Theo was dead (from diphtheria), and Sebastianâ€™s life would never be the same. His parents, heartbroken and unwilling to lose their only son and heir, isolated and suffocated him in an overprotective reaction to Theoâ€™s death. Frustrated and resentful, Sebastian departed for the continent the moment he was free of their control and has spent past seven years making up for lost time â€“ earning the sobriquet â€œwickedâ€.
When word reaches him that his father has suffered an apoplexy and heâ€™s needed at home, Sebastian rapidly departs for England. The timing is fortuitous â€“ heâ€™s begun to tire of his wild lifestyle and has forgiven his father for his suffocating childhood. Heâ€™s anxious to form a new relationship with Lord Wingham â€“ if heâ€™s still alive when he finally makes it back. Twenty-two days later Sebastian arrives home only to discover the letter exaggerated his fatherâ€™s illness. But the apoplexy, though not as serious as his sister insinuated, provides just the catalyst necessary for the men to reconcile formally, and the visit marks a change in their relationship.
For years, rumors about Sebastianâ€™s exploits, duels and romantic liaisons have provided fodder for the scandal sheets, and on his arrival in London, speculation is rampant and frenzied. Women are attracted to him, and men are eager to challenge him to newer, ever more daring wagers. Cassandra â€“ Cassie â€“ Delahaye, however, isnâ€™t. Wicked (distant) cousin Sebastian sounds more like a fool than a catch, and despite her younger sister Oliviaâ€™s eagerness to gossip about him, Cassie is more interested in one of the gentlemen currently currying her favor, the handsome Richard Penhaligon. Intelligent, practical and pragmatic about her prospects, Cassie longs to be swept off her feet and isnâ€™t willing to settle. Yet.
After visiting his father, Sebastian makes plans to visit London, well aware of the fact that his wicked past wonâ€™t be as easy to leave behind as he hoped. A wager between him and his close friend Adrian Devereux, Earl of Sarre (The Player) paves the way for Sebastianâ€™s return and he makes his re-entrance into London society at the Cavendish ball where heâ€™s immediately besieged by single females eager for his attention. Anxious to escape the hordes, he ducks into the library. When heâ€™s followed by a trio of chits barely out of the schoolroom, Sebastian admonishes them for their inappropriate behavior and shames them into leaving him alone. Only he isnâ€™t. Hidden behind a couch is Cassie â€“ who took refuge there to avoid a particularly eager suitor.
When Cassie reveals herself, Sebastian is quick to think the worst and lumps her in with all the other ladies angling for his attention, but Cassie quickly sets him straight. Sparks fly â€“ until a knock on the door interrupts them and sends Cassie back to her hiding place. She listens as Sebastianâ€™s former mistress, Miranda Silvarez, enters, and tells him sheâ€™s now widowed and free to remarry. Alarm bells start ringing, but right now, Sebastian knows he canâ€™t afford for Miranda to discover Cassieâ€™s presence, so he distracts her, kisses her and urges her out of the library. Sheâ€™s confused but goes and Cassie escapes â€“ but the die is cast. Cassie is intrigued by Sebastian; Sebastian is attracted to his feisty library companion. When he sends her violets the following day, signed Y.W.C.S., Cassie is similarly smitten.
Up until this first unorthodox meeting, and even for a bit after it, I loved everything about The Wicked Cousin. The premise, the characters, the lead up â€“ itâ€™s all wonderful. But from here on out, the story doesnâ€™t quite live up to its potential. Sparks fly between Sebastian and Cassie from the moment they meet, and when Sebastian is folded into Cassieâ€™s circle of friends (the Rockliffe set â€“ featured in the previous books), they find themselves often in each otherâ€™s company. Lust quickly becomes love, and before long Sebastian is asking Cassieâ€™s fatherâ€™s permission to court her. Unfortunately, Miranda Silvarez continues to plague Sebastian, and with help from Richard Penhaligon, whoâ€™s currently enjoying her favors, sheâ€™s doing a bang-up job. The mistress side-plot adds a bit of intrigue, but aside from a few delicious stolen kisses and a terrifically sexy scene at a masquerade when Sebastian spots Cassie in a risquÃ© costume and canâ€™t believe itâ€™s herâ€¦ there isnâ€™t a whole lot more to the story.
If you opened this book hoping for a wicked hero, Sebastian is a bit of a disappointment. This story is about his redemption, and he goes from naughty hottie to just plain hottie in short order. I loved him and his brilliant red hair, and those moments when he loses his cool over Cassie (theyâ€™re terrific, and too few and far between), but after that prologue, the â€˜newâ€™ Sebastian is a bit too good. Which leads me to my other major problem â€“ Cassie, though likeable, dulls in comparison to him, and Iâ€™m not sure Ms. Riley does enough to convince me sheâ€™s the one to finally bring him to his knees.
A hallmark of the Rockliffe series, and Ms. Rileyâ€™s books in general, is her wonderful casts of secondary characters. Featuring a diverse cast of friends and acquaintances, all of whom orbit the Duke of Rockliffeâ€™s world, itâ€™s an interesting mix of single and married men and women. The group are fiercely loyal to one another and while I do love the interplay between them (I do! I promise!), by the end of the book, perhaps Iâ€™m a cynic, but they all begin to read as a bit too good to be true. Rockliffe is omniscient (heâ€™s so yummy!), the friends are always ready and willing to help each other, and thereâ€™s no circumstance the group canâ€™t overcome. Itâ€™s awesome â€“ but itâ€™s also overkill. Cassieâ€™s family gets a similar treatment. Iâ€™m reluctant to criticize them because theyâ€™re so damned great and itâ€™s a nice change from the standard overbearing parents featured in historical romance, but is it realistic? Sir Charles quickly accepts Sebastianâ€™s explanations for his past and current contretemps with Mistress Silvarez, but Iâ€™m not convinced his response is typical or appropriate. Cassie, his pride and joy...

,"Horror, Zombies, Young Adult, Science Fiction, Dystopia, Fantasy",Bonnie,"DNF @ 13%
I had been heading towards a slump so that may be part of the reason for my complete intolerance and unwillingness to give this a chance, but this just did not work for me. Warm Bodies was an original (and slightly disturbing) tale of a zombie falling in love with a human, subsequently regaining his humanity in the process. It was a moving and touching novel in the unlikeliest of genres. The New Hunger was even more fantastic, well written, and it made me more excited than I had been for The Burning World to release. But before I had even hit double digits in progress, I was already ready to call it quits. This section was at 7%:
â€˜Her irises are the usual metallic gray, but as I stare into them, they flicker. A brief glint, like a flake of gold in the sand of a deep river.â€™
Very pretty words. Marion can definitely string some adjectives and metaphors together but then he had to go and mess it all up.
â€œWhat is it?â€ Julie asks in an awed whisper.
â€œI have no idea. Iâ€™ve never had less idea about anything. Weâ€™ve been calling it â€˜the Gleam.â€™ Every once in a while it justâ€¦ happens, and the Dead get a little less dead.â€
And that is all we get by way of explanation.
[image error]
It was just such a lame and half-assed attempt at explaining the whole plot point. The dead coming back to life after being zombies, being deadâ€¦ and you give it some fancy capitalized name and thatâ€™s supposed to be sufficient? Sorry, but that just doesnâ€™t work for me. I continued reading up to 13% where the settlement is attacked by a rival settlement and it officially became just like all other post-apocalyptic/zombie tales that Iâ€™ve already read at least half a dozen times. Does it switch it up somehow and become original and memorable again? Maybe. The introduction into this unexpected sequel was so lackluster that it wasnâ€™t interesting enough for me to stick around to find out.

The major complaint Iâ€™ve seen about it is that itâ€™s â€œboring.â€ And I get that. And like, Iâ€™m really sorry, but depression is not exactly a day trip to the amusement park.

If you donâ€™t want to read a depiction of mourning and depression and a semi-realistically-staged healing process, thatâ€™s fair - so just STAY AWAY. Donâ€™t blame the book for being boring. Itâ€™s not fun to be depressed.
There were bits of the overall depiction that I didnâ€™t like. Things that felt too convenient, or dramatic, or cheesy. There was a strange twist I never understood, and the relationship at the core of the text confused me to no end, and there was maybe a little too much hope. (Depression isnâ€™t there and gone.)
But generally, this is one of the better renditions of depression Iâ€™ve seen in YA. Itâ€™s also so f*cking good at discussing some of the difficulties of going to college. It captures that initial loneliness.
(Wow. Iâ€™m really making myself excited to start all over again when I start at a whole new college at the end of the summer. Yay, transferring.)
Jesus Christ I wish I had a half star. This book was not a three star read, but Iâ€™m equally opposed to giving it four, goddamn it.
Anyway. I feel preach-y and I hate myself for it and I want to shut up. So Iâ€™m just going to say this book is also beautifully written and then throw in some quotes and leave.
Bottom line: Only read it if you know what youâ€™re getting into. Because if you two-star it for being boring after reading this review, I get to pinch you.
Read the fine print.

,"Fantasy, Fiction, Short stories, Feminisim, Comics, Superheroes, Science Fiction, Sequential Art, Comics",Lisa,"Review from Tenacious Reader: http://www.tenaciousreader.com/2017/0...
I love the concept of this book which gives voice to those sidelined females in comic books. It creates fleshed out characters that have motivations and thoughts and intriguing stories all their own. It shows they are something more than just a footnote in the story of a super hero.
And this book is all that, which is wonderful. However, this is going to be a hard one for me to review. When it comes down to it, while I love the concept and the general stories, the style itself is just not a style that works well for me. That does not mean itâ€™s poorly executed by any means. This is a book where the type of humor just really fell flat for me. This is not an unusual struggle for me, it happens often enough I can recognize when I have issue due to the style rather than the writerâ€™s ability to craft a story. I can also recognize the areas that this book fell flat for me may very well be what makes it a stand out in a very positive way for others.
The book covers 6 different protagonists, each one with a unique story and situation (often a familiar one, though all names have been changed). It is a fun concept. And the way all of these chapters are tied together is through the Hell Hath Club. It is a an afterlife hangout where all of these women can go and share there stories.
And when it comes down to it, the entire point of these stories is not to make people laugh, but to learn to appreciate how often women in the standard stories are there only to progress the male story line. They are merely dispensable stepping stones that are given little thought or depth, just a byline in the story of the male protagonist. Valente finally gives them a voice and the ability to stand up and be known. It makes a statement that and gives people something to think about the next time they come across a super hero story with women that could easily join the Hell Hath Club. (less)",Netral
,"Fiction, Historical, Historical Fiction",Liz,"This book, told in Lillianâ€™s voice, is pitch perfect. It captures the times, the place and the woman perfectly. It just felt like I was right in Lillianâ€™s head. Lillian and I were born 50+ years apart, but so many of the issues were the same for both of us, like being one of the few women in our profession and fighting for equal pay. It also struck me that I'm reading this on Equal Pay Day in 2017, so some things still haven't changed.
But the message here is to enjoy life no matter what it throws at you. As Lillian says â€œ...she had it backwards. It wasn't that happiness led to humor, but more that humor could lead, perhaps, to happiness - that an eye for the absurd could keep one active in oneâ€™s despair, the opposite of depressed: static and passive.â€ And it's not as if Lillian had an easy life. She has to quit her beloved job when she gets pregnant, suffers a breakdown and goes through a divorce. But she is a survivor.
I love that at age 85, Lillian is able to walk more miles than most women half her age. She is a strong character in so many ways. It lent a whole new level of appreciation when I learned Lillian was based on a real person, Margaret Fishback.
Highly recommend this book.

,"Nonfiction, History, Race, Politics, Cultural, African American, Writing, Essays",Lisbet,"My boyfriend surprised me with this book after we saw the movie. The movie was incredibly powerful, moving, and relevant. When it ended, the majority of the audience sat in silence through the credits. When the credits ended, I still had a hard time leaving. It left me wanting more. Wanting answers, solutions, an honest conversation about race. I clearly wasn't the only one, as another patron asked ""Well, what now? Where do we go from here?"" as we sat in the now almost empty, brightly lit theater.
The book is a companion piece to the movie and while it could stand alone, I don't think it would have the same power as it does having seen the movie. I hear Baldwin's voice when I read the passages he wrote, can picture his mannerisms, and see his eyes looking into mine. His words are beautifully lyrical, poetical, and yet there's a very striking dissonance between the beauty of his voice and the often ugly things he's discussing.
What the book does is allow you to read one or two pages and really appreciate what Baldwin was saying. Sentences that I was struggling to remember as I walked out of the theater are now available to be re-read, dissected, and memorized.
One passage, in particular, that really stuck with me, seems so relevant in light of the opposition and demonization surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement:
""[When] any white man in the world says ""give me liberty, or give me death,"" the entire white world applauds. When a black man says exactly the same thing, word for word, he is judged a criminal and treated like one and everything possible is done to make an example of this bad nigger, so there won't be any more like him.""

,"Romance, M M Romance, War, Military Fiction, Contemporary",Jewel,"Afraid to Fly is the second book in LA Witt's Anchor Point series. I loved the first book, Just Drive, and have been looking forward to Travis' story.
Both MC's are bisexual, and I did love how that was handled and I loved that neither man got crap for it on base. I want to think that the military is becoming more accepting in the wake of the DADT repeal, and I liked that it was just no big deal in the story.
Commander Travis Wilson used to be a hot shot fighter pilot, until a very bad landing crash 8 years ago, took him and his RIO out of the game. Travis is still walking and serving in the Navy, but he suffers awful chronic back pain, and walks with a permanent limp. Travis has been married, and divorced, a couple times and has a wonderful 22 year old daughter. They look out for each other. Travis has slept with plenty of guys over the years, but he's only ever fallen for one, and he's still not quite over him. Up until now, Travis has had a much easier time emotionally connecting with women.
Lieutenant Commander Clint Fraser is new to Anchor Point, having been transferred to NAS Adams from Nellis, in Nevada. He was a drone pilot, but a highly classified mission went sideways and it derailed him in the worst way possible. Clint took to self-medicating, with alcohol, because that was the only thing that would numb everything, and, well, that cost him his marriage, of 16 years and his 3 kids, and almost his career.
We don't actually see much of Clint's ex-wife or kids, just 3 or 4 Skype calls. I understand she's come a long way since the divorce, but she starts out seeming pretty bitter, still, and I really hated that she treated him like his PTSD wasn't real, or that he should just be able to get over it. Sure, he was never physically in danger, but being directly responsible for the deaths of other humans takes its toll, no matter the situation. And that he's not allowed to talk about it, even to a counselor with clearance, means he has to try to come to terms with what happened all by himself.
That Clint's ex-wife was so flippant about it, pretty much pissed me off. And that she used his PTSD against him in the custody battle with Clint, and uses it as an excuse to not even let him see his kids angered me even more. I really do understand why they got divorced. Living with someone who is self-destructive, especially when there are kids involved, is a tough situation. But, he's been sober for a year and a half, and he's doing what he can to cope with the PTSD. What angers me, though, is that no matter what he does, now, it didn't seem good enough for her, for most of the book. She starts coming around by the end, though, so maybe there is some hope to be had.
And Travis, well, he's super gun shy about the thought of falling in love with another man. That's only happened for him once before and he still blames himself for how that turned out. Is he responsible? No, he isn't, but that doesn't stop him from using it as an excuse to shut down thoughts of relationships.
Unlike Just Drive, Afraid to Fly is lighter on the steam than I've generally seen from this author. Because of Travis's back injury, most sexual activity, including anything anal - giving or receiving - are off the table. Oral and hand jobs are very much ok, though, so that's what he and Clint get up to. It worked for them, though, so I'm fine with it. What steam we got was sexy, in my opinion. I kind of wonder why Travis never thought to use a dildo on Clint, though. I get why he couldn't take one, himself, for the same reason actual intercourse was off the table, but I think he and Clint could have had lots of fun with a dildo. Just sayin'.
Sadly, while I liked Afraid to Fly, it didn't really wow me. The story seemed way too long and drawn out and I was just waiting for something, anything, to happen. In fact, everything is too perfect between them until Travis freaks the fuck out about his feelings and runs away. That just seemed soâ€¦manufactured, I guess. So, while I am happy that Travis and Clint found each other, I feel pretty tepid to the story, overall.

Genre: Young Adult Mystery - Thriller - Horror
The Dead List by Jennifer L. Armentrout did not disappoint! It's along the lines of popular teen screams like I Know What You Did Last Summer, Valentine, and Scream. Why? It's dark, bloody, violent, and full or revenge. The novel follows a couple of teens who are essentially being stalked by a serial killer. At first, they can't understand why this is happening, but as the bodies start to pile up a motive begins to show itself.
Readers are going to be taken on this gruesome journey with Ella and Jensen as they try to survive the brutal killings that are targeting their friends. Not only that, you will see the budding, second chance romance between the two as they slowly come to realize that they have had feelings for one another after all these years. In some instances, their romance is pure heart stopper, while in others, I had a hard time coming to terms with their relationship as it wasn't realistic to the plot (who slowly falls in love when being targeted by a killer?!?!). Regardless, I liked it none the less, and think it's perfect for the teen reader.
A few things that bothered me in terms of this story is that the characters interactions were a bit juvenile for my tastes. But then again, the target audience will be for young adults so I can look past this. Another thing, as mentioned above, is the romantic aspects of the novel. I have a hard time understanding how Ella and Jensen could find love with each other when they are being targeted by a killer... It's quite strange but again, will probably work well for younger viewers. Finally, Ella's actions (or lack of fear) bordered on silly. Had someone attacked me 2 days before I wouldn't be going to school... I mean, she was literally almost strangled to death and she's more worried about missing the first day of school? Again, this comes down to the juvenile quality of the story. So knowing all this, I just want adult readers to understand what they are getting into prior to diving into this novel. This is not be saying I didn't like the book because I DID. It's just more targeted for the younger reader and will therefore have an effect on those who don't tend to read YA literature.
With that, this is a sold novel by the author and I am glad I managed to get some time together to sit down and enjoy it. I liked being able to reminisce about my favorite types of teen screams while reading this one, and I think many will agree.

,"Fiction, Mystery, Contemporary",Rachel,"I received a copy of this book from netgalley in exchange for an honest review.
I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from The Fall of Lisa Bellow. Iâ€™d never heard of Susan Perabo, but the blurb grabbed me with its promise of similarities to Everything I Never Told You and Room, two of the best books Iâ€™ve read so far in 2016. This can be a double edged sword, going into a book with such high expectations. Fortunately, Lisa Bellow lived up to this tall order.
This is the story of Meredith Oliver, an insecure eighth grade girl who goes into the local deli for a root beer after school, only to witness a robbery and the kidnapping of Lisa Bellow, the pretty, popular girl who Meredith had always disdained. This summary may make it sound like a thriller, but itâ€™s not. This is a quiet character study of a novel, and a careful examination into the psychology of those affected by trauma. In the aftermath of the event, Meredith grapples with the guilt of being the one left behind, and feels a closeness to Lisa that sheâ€™s unable to understand. While the obvious choice would have been to center this story around Lisaâ€™s abduction, Susan Perabo opts for the often unexamined perspective: the story of the girl who didnâ€™t get taken, whose life was changed by the event in less ostensible, less quantifiable ways.
This novel weaves between Meredithâ€™s point of view and that of her mother, Claire, whose older son has also recently undergone a severe ordeal. While I thought Meredith was a compelling narrator - insecure, scared, and vulnerable - I found it difficult to sympathize with Claire. I wouldnâ€™t say that I prefer characters to be likable, necessarily - with female characters especially, I think itâ€™s important to let them be flawed and honest, even if it means sacrificing more â€˜desirable' characteristics. But for some reason, I never found Claire compelling in her imperfection: I never wanted to dig to the root of her flaws, to really understand her. It didnâ€™t matter so much that I didnâ€™t like her; the problem was that I found myself completely unable to care.
My indifference toward Claireâ€™s character is my main criticism. Otherwise I thought this was a very impressive debut novel. Peraboâ€™s prose was both incisive and compelling; she creates a captivating, page-turning read which both stimulates and challenges the reader. Finally, it bears repeating: donâ€™t go into this novel expecting a thriller. Sure, youâ€™ll want to know what happened to Lisa, but donâ€™t expect that to be the point. This is Meredithâ€™s story, in all its messiness and tension and fragility. Perabo bypasses any temptation to sanitize or sensationalize this story, and deftly cuts to the heart of the drama in a way which is admirably real. A very thought-provoking read. (less)",Negatif
,"Erotica, Bdsm, Romance, M M Romance",Drizz,"It's pretty clear that David's writing improved between the first 2 Custos Securities books and this one. The POV was way more clear (it didn't jump about mid paragraph like it did in the first 2 books). The first books annoyed me because there was a lot of telling instead of showing. But she definitely improved on that in this book. I enjoyed the stories for the other books but the writing was frustrating.
With this book, I enjoyed both the writing and the story. It had an easy feel. I find that David still over-describes and uses unnecessarily flowery language but that's just a personal reaction.
The story was solid. I'm iffy on Gideon but I love Sebastian. I definitely shed some tears.
I don't usually like the ""I'm not good enough for you so I'm going to make sure I don't let you fall in love with me"" trope. But I knew going in that the trope was going to take centre stage so I still really enjoyed it.

A really enjoyable book and I think an improvement on the first Custos books.

,"Horror, Zombies, Young Adult, Science Fiction, Dystopia, Fantasy",Christy LoveOfBooks,"I think most people have heard of Warm Bodies by now, right? It's a novel that was turned into a movie. It's a nice spin on zombies regaining their humanity with a mixture of action, romance, and humor. I loved both formats, so I was excited when a sequel was announced. Whoa, I wasn't expecting just how freaking good The Burning World would be! I don't want to diminish how good Warm Bodies is, but TBW is almost a different beast. The writing, the plot, and even the characters are better.
Warm Bodies left us with a nice HEA feeling, but oh boy, it was only the beginning of something huge. We're taken on a thrilling ride with Julie, R, and a few friends as they find themselves embroiled with a sinister organization. What they uncover is craaaaazy! All the while, R's memories are beginning to surface, and they aren't exactly welcome. Oh, but are they ever mind-blowing!
I remember loving the characters in WB, but it's grown even more with this book. Julie still has a temper and is quick to react (which I love), but there's something deeper to her now that made me empathize more with her. And I absolutely adore the friendship between Julie and Nora! M, too!

,"Nonfiction, Psychology, Science, Technology, Business",ATJG,"This is a gutless book.
Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked purports to be an examination of contemporary media and their addictive qualities, yet very few of these pages explore any such ground. Rather, Alter parades psychological experiment after psychological experiment after psychological experiment, one after another, again and again, mice pressing levers to receive the orgasm drug, pigeons pecking buttons for food pellets, kittens kept in dark rooms before being put in cylinders with stripy patterns, and so on. The reader it seems, is left to draw her own conclusions.
Each time one of these laboratory escapades comes close to being compelling in the context of digital media, Alter swerves away, as if it was his mission to avoid saying anything the least bit original or interesting. The worst instance is with the (very brief) discussion of pornography. In 320 pages of text--about addictive tech, remember--pornography is allocated exactly two pages. And what's worse is these two pages serve only to prop up a half-baked rehash of Freudian theories of repression, in this case, about inhabitants of States of conservative persuasion being more inclined to open their browser for purposes of self-abuse than the good people of, say, Vermont. No mention whatsoever of the modern malaise resultant from constant and early exposure to literally anything you want. No mention of the ways addiction to pornography can compound addiction to digital technology. No mention of the tension between cerebral attempts at self-control and the reptilian brain stem and its unceasing demands. Instead, we merely get the banal (and predictable) observation that societal repression creates urgent needs for release.
Any discussion of violence and its appeal is totally absent. Alter discusses video game addiction, but only Tetris and World of Warcraft, and in the latter case, the mechanism of addiction is left untouched in favor of a tedious gloss of one individual's tendency to draw the blinds, give up all efforts to maintain personal hygiene, and play WoW for months on end. One wonders why Alter didn't here turn again to Freud and explore video games as an outlet for aggression. Indeed, leaving both sex and violence as aspects in digital technology addiction unexplored is unforgivable.
But, I have to concede, perhaps it's me who's the fool. I did, after all, go into this book looking for an intensive examination of where the hands have come to on the clock, and instead I got a pretty lousy pop-psychology book that offered little of value. I guess the blurb by Malcolm Gladwell on the cover should have given me a clue. But it's over now. /rant (less)",Negatif

By Your Side is the second book I've read by Kasie West, and although I didn't love it quite as much as the first, it was still an enjoyable read.
Our story starts with Autumn, a teenage girl who is supposed to be going to a cabin with her friends for the weekend, but somehow manages to get herself locked inside a library for the weekend. For a lot of us, this would be a dream come true, but Autumn has anxiety and this is something of a nightmare for her. Thankfully, she finds out quickly she's not there alone. Dax, a guy from her high school is there as well. His story is much different than Autumn's, but he helps her more than he knows.
Though these two have a strange dynamic at first, they do become friends eventually. They learn a lot about each other being locked together in that library. When they get out, though... things change. Dax is back to his life, and Autumn is back to her family and friends. I wasn't sure how things were going to work out between them and I do wish that they figured it out a little faster, but I was happy with how the story ends.

His confidence is inspiring and contagious with unexpected results.
Mr. Konigsberg deftly demonstrates the challenges and misconceptions that so many homosexual, bisexual, and gender-fluid teenagers are forced to face. Honestly Ben is a spot-on, spectacular Young Adult read. I will be donating my copy to my favorite HS classroom, of course.

,"Horror, fiction, Fantasy, Science Fiction, Audio book ",Paul O'Neill,"EDIT - 5-Aug-2018 - Changed to five stars as all of these stories are still with me.
A fantastic collection of novellas from Joe Hill, all with their own unique feel and a loose link to weather of some sort.
This collection shows off Hillâ€™s ability to write such believable characters (for the most part) and intriguing / non-typical plots
Here is my ranking of each story:
1. Loaded - Hillâ€™s story about the â€˜hard onâ€™ america has with guns is the best thing Iâ€™ve read all year. Such an amazing story, well told with all the tragedy youâ€™d expect.
2. Aloft - Teenager gets stuck on a cloud...not really much else to say as a synopsis. This is definately the most whimsical of the four stories but I felt it was very imaginative.
3. Snapshot - Tough to describe this one without spoiling it all but itâ€™s the scariest story in the bunch set during the polaroid era. Very sinister.
4. Rain - The only one of the four stories that I didnâ€™t enjoy much. It had its ups and downs but I couldnâ€™t get onboard with it for some reason. Razor sharp rain falls from the sky, kills everyone. What makes this one interesting is that when Hill wrote it first time around it featured a time when a female president was in power with a much â€˜happierâ€™ ending. I donâ€™t think Hill likes Trump much.
Joe Hill is fast becoming one of my favourite authors and this showcases some of his best writing yet.

This is one of my all-time favorite PNR (Paranormal Romance) series. S.L. Jennings knows how to grab your attention and throw you into a world you never want to leave.
â€œHe fell from Heaven for the one he thought he loved, only to find he was manipulated by Lucifer and his unquenchable thirst for power. He rose from Hell to rid the world of his brotherâ€™s treachery, turning his back on his true nature in a quest for salvation. And now, he would fall again. He would fall for something much greater than he and the Se7en ever anticipated. He would fall for the silver-haired girl who set his world aflame, the girl he was originally sent to assassinate. He would fall for love.â€
If youâ€™ve read the previous two books then you are probably like meâ€¦.stuck between two fallen angels trying to figure out which one you love more. If you havenâ€™t read the previous booksâ€¦..TURN BACK NOW. Iâ€™m not going to spoil this novel, but I may bring up things or situations from the other two and I promiseâ€¦.you donâ€™t want this series ruined for you.
This book picks up basically where End of Eden left off with all of the same players making an appearance, but itâ€™s different and each of them have more to lose this time around when they find that some of them having been a part of a centuries old planâ€¦a plan that is on-the-edge-of-your-seat nerve wrecking, and they didnâ€™t even know it. Loyalties get tested, war is imminent, and this plan may just happen whether they want it to or not.
This book completely ruined me. Syreeta pulled me into this world so effortlessly and I never wanted to leave it. My heart literally ached while reading this bookâ€¦thatâ€™s how good of a writer Syreeta is. She has this ability to make you feel so much and connect so easily with her characters. The wait was definitely worth it!
And I think itâ€™s worth mentioning, there IS a huge cliffhanger that will leave you in a pile of mush on the floor. I didnâ€™t even know it was the endâ€¦.I kept swiping and swiping hoping to find more, but nopeâ€¦she stopped it and my heart dropped! I cannot wait for the next part of this amazingly well written story!!

,"Fiction, Did Not Finish, Classics, Modern Classics",Breakaway Reviewers,"I am commenting on this book solely on my finding it totally unreadable. I managed the first seventy odd pages without having a clue who the narrator is and where the book is going. It seems to be an acid-fuelled commentary on a musical band from the early 1980s whose few live performances were complete secrets. They are renowned for being unknown.
The narrator is unsure whether his memories are real or the result of a particularly vivid 'trip', but he has been engaged to write a retrospective on them.
Having said all that, it is well written in terms of grammar and style and I am not condemning it as a bad book; it is clear from other reviews that other people loved it but, much as I hate giving up on a book, life is too short and regrettably it failed to engage me.

,"Thriller, Fiction, Mystery, Crime, Audiobook",Jill,"This well-constructed thriller will have your adrenaline pumping from the very beginning. This is apparently the second in a series about Nick Mason, and I did not read the first, but had no trouble catching on.
Nick Mason had been incarcerated for felony murder when a fellow robbery conspirator killed someone while the robbery was being committed. Mason got released from federal prison in Terre Haute after serving five and a half years, thanks to an unwritten contract he made with a very powerful prisoner, Darius Cole. Cole orchestrated Masonâ€™s release so Mason could work for him on the outside. For getting his life back (in a way), Mason agreed to be on call twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, to do whatever was asked of him, â€œno matter what it was.â€
In essence, and in spite of being opposed to murder, Mason became Coleâ€™s â€œangel of death,â€ performing executions of those Cole wanted eliminated. But, â€œâ€¦even though Mason killed people, complete strangers, he lived by a code: No innocent victims.â€
Another of Coleâ€™s â€œemployees,â€ Marcus Quintero, provides Mason with his assignments and the weaponry to carry it out. In the first operation we read about as the book opens, Mason has to get through between ten and twelve â€œhigh-end guysâ€ to get to the target. This is considered to be not a problem for Mason, even though he was not an assassin prior to his conviction for robbery.
This target, as well as the second assigned to Mason, is set to testify against Cole in his upcoming retrial. Cole has no intention of letting these potential witnesses live to do that, in spite of their being very heavily protected. Somehow, with all Coleâ€™s connections on the outside, he manages to find out where these men are and exactly how they are guarded. He also has a bead on every aspect of Masonâ€™s life in order to keep Mason under his thumb. So, for example, when Mason is sent out on a job, if he doesnâ€™t do what he has been told to do, Mason understands that Quinteroâ€™s job is to go take out Masonâ€™s ex-wife and daughter, both of whom are the most important people in Masonâ€™s life. It was to continue to see them and to protect them that Mason made the deal with Cole and continues to honor it.
Nevertheless, Mason keeps trying to come up with an â€œexit strategyâ€ to get himself out of this situation. Coleâ€™s tentacles are pretty deep, however, more so than Mason had imagined possible.
Discussion: This book has excellent discussions of the legal issues surrounding Coleâ€™s retrial, and a fun look at the culture of Southside Irish Chicago. Hamilton is also to be commended for integrating into his story some important aspects of policing in Chicago, such as the much maligned honor code and the notorious secret detention and interrogation site at Homan Square.
But Coleâ€™s success at infiltration and compromising people seems a little improbable, as does Masonâ€™s success as an assassin against huge odds. Nevertheless, it makes for exciting reading.
Hamilton is also very good at making a killer (Nick Mason) sympathetic. This aspect helps offset the gritty, dark, and violent aspects of the story.
Evaluation: This thriller will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat.
Rating: 3.5/5

,"Fantasy, Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction, Young Adult, Fairy Tales",Emily May,"A beautiful, pastoral fairy tale set in a fantasy version of medieval Russia.
Narrated in lyrical prose and third-person past tense, Arden weaves a tale no less compelling for its slow, gradual development. Like all the best fairy tales, the author draws on the setting - a village in the northern woods of Rus' - to create an atmosphere that promises magic and suggests many horrors.
Atmosphere is the key word here: The Bear and the Nightingale captures that feeling of uncertainty and superstition. The characters are somewhere between the old and the new; believing in modern religion but still deeply tied to the stories of old - the creatures that hide in the dark, the demons lurking in corners, the spirits living in the woods.
The protagonist is Vasya, a feisty, stubborn girl who always manages to find her way into adventure and, often, trouble. Quick-witted and rebellious, it's hard not to fall in love with her instantly. There's a sense throughout that she is at one with nature, belonging to the very setting of the novel - the wild, rugged landscape of her youth. She is most at home when running and playing in the woods.
When her father remarries and brings Vasya's intense and devout new stepmother back to their village, the safety of everyone is threatened. Her stepmother refuses to appease the creatures of the forest and darkness creeps ever closer. The arrival of a young priest who challenges the people's belief in the old spirits endangers them further. It is Vasya - and her own strange gifts - who is the family's only chance against the evil spirits at work.
A haunting story; one so deeply atmospheric that you can almost feel the cold air on your skin as you're reading.

,"Young Adult, Contemporary, Fiction, Health, Mental Health",Em (RunawayWithDreamthieves),"I donâ€™t know how a book can splinter in my mind with a haze of pain around it, make tears spring unbidden to my eyes and generally feel as though I was seeing into a bottomless well of anguish, but then, right when I thought the flint shell of my heart would crack, it hits me with a keen pang of hope and sets like a little ball of tingling warmth in the pit of my stomach.
A List of Cages is a beautiful, soul-crushing love letter to friendships that heal the broken pathways of your heart and hope that canâ€™t be washed away by the torrent of despair, to the pain we survive in youth and to the courage it takes to will your fragments into finding a way to mesh back together into a single person. Itâ€™s a reminder that we are better than the worst things that weâ€™ve been made to endure. But mostly, this book was a sigh of relief at the knowledge that kindness can exist in this world, and the mournful remorse of kindness existing in a world that doesnâ€™t really deserve it.
After the death of his parents in a tragic accident, Julian Harlowâ€™s life had smashed and spilled him tumbling away from the loving foster home of Adam Blake and his mother into the brutal guardianship of his uncle. Five years later, Adamâ€”a seniorâ€”is assigned the duty of escorting a freshman to the counseling sessions he persists in skipping. The freshman is none other than his former foster brother, Julian.
Adam is thrilled to be reunited with his friend, but the years have remade Julian into a shadow version of himself and no matter how much Adam tried to root through what was hidden in the labyrinth of Julianâ€™s memories, his burden was to feel all the pain of Julianâ€™s unspoken torment, and not know how to help him. But while Adam was thinking of Julianâ€™s bruises and frequent absences and his uncleâ€™s house that conjured no feeling of â€œhomeâ€, another thought tiptoed between them. It was sly, odious and unnameable, and it waited to be noticed...
In this book, we see the vast extent of damage abuseâ€”both physical and emotionalâ€”inflicts on survivors. How weary oneâ€™s chest becomes from carrying all the repeated hope and disappointment and how so used they become to the right way being painful that they begin to doubt any path that doesnâ€™t come with agony. We see how abusers learn to masquerade as things that wouldnâ€™t seem threatening to get close enough to strike and how oftentimes theyâ€™re the same people who are supposed to protect you from the ravages of the world but instead wrap their manipulations in the chain of the security and sense of self-worth which they claim to offer you.
But nothing broke my heart more than how quick everyoneâ€”his classmates, his teachers, his principleâ€”was to fill Julianâ€™s silences with their own interpretation: He was depressed. He was awkward. He was weird. He was stuck up. He was judgmental. They couldnâ€™t read him so they wrote their own story, and they didnâ€™t care enough to see into the pain that traced along each one of his unspoken scars. They were all continuously watching this massive, looming thing over Julianâ€™s life to which they were supposed to promptly apply the adjective dangerous and immediately act. But they didnâ€™tâ€”not until it was too late anyway. And the fact that Robin Roe herself is a counselor and a mentor for at-risk teenagers who must have encountered many cases like this in real life still nudges at the dark of my thoughts.
A List of Cages is moving, horrifying, magnificent. There were moments that made my insides feel bruised and moments that were the equivalent of the boom in your heart when you hear a firework explode. Donâ€™t let the charming exterior fool you. Step into this book, and it will step into you.
It was heart-breakingly hard to read, yes, but Iâ€™m grateful for the bedrock of love and affection that was always there, because the real story, ultimately, is in the relationships. This is a book that drips with love and approaches its characters with a whole-hearted delight in their differences, similarities, and connectionsâ€”Adamâ€™s utter, unflinching aura of love that was all around him and Julianâ€™s jangling, nerve-racking, mind-screaming strength.
Julian and Adamâ€™s friendship made me cry. That friendship was the moon, the gentle glow that illuminated the darkness around Julian. It made it easier to see the path stretching before him, and Julian stumbled less in its light, and found himself looking up at it in awe, cheeks lit by its radiance. Itâ€™s that friendship and it's that kindness that eventually uncovered the border between hope and despair that had become lost in the fear.
I think the greatest takeaway from this book is that maybe thereâ€™s not much any of us can do: youâ€™re small and weak and helpless and you can be so clumsy with words when words mean so much. But you know you can be kind. And sometimes, I believe, that changes the world. So please, please, if anything, just be kind.
TRIGGER WARNINGS: violence, emotional and physical abuse.

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction, Art",Jenny Baker,"This is a perfect Sunday read. The pacing is what youâ€™d expect and desire in a historical fiction novel. It allows you to settle back and enjoy the story, no rush or desire to be rushed. It was a relaxing and cleansing reading experience that I needed after reading mystery/thrillers and fantasy novels.
My first experience with a Christina Baker Kline novel was Orphan Train, which I loved, and was thrilled to hear that she had a new novel out. If you haven't read Orphan Train, I highly recommend it.
Iâ€™d never heard of the artist Andrew Wyeth or his painting â€œChristinaâ€™s Worldâ€ until I read this novel. Iâ€™m beginning to love historical novels about famous artists. Now that I've seen his painting, the book cover makes sense. Another historical fiction novel that I read was The Marriage of Opposites by Alice Hoffman, which was partly about the painter Camille Pissarro.
There were so many things that I loved about this book. Itâ€™s a delightful read all round. First of all, Christina Baker Klineâ€™s writing has a natural flow to it with nothing feeling forced. The audiobook narrator, Polly Stone, has a dynamic voice giving distinct voices for the different characters. The dialogue writing is just as distinct. The author gives the illusion of effortless character development, which means she had to work like hell to give that impression. The time period jumps around, but the story still feels seamless.
I love it when authors mention other works in their novels. In A Piece of the World, the author mentions Emily Dickinson poems, The House of Seven Gables, and Ethan Frome. I may be missing a few.
There were moments during some of the conversations between the characters that really struck me, but for different reasons. In this scene, Ramona is consoling Christina after she receives news about an ex-boyfriend.
Leaning forward in the rocker, Ramona says, â€œChristina, listen to me. There will be other fish in the sea.â€
â€œNo, there wonâ€™t.â€
â€œThere will. Weâ€™ll find you a great catch.â€
â€œI have hung up my rod,â€ I say.
This seems to break the tension. Ramona smiles. (It was hard for her to be this serious! She isnâ€™t constitutionally cut out for it.)
â€œFor now. Thereâ€™ll be more expeditions.â€
Not in this leaky boat.â€
She laughs a little. â€œYou are as stubborn as a Maine coon, Christina Olson.â€
â€œMaybe so,â€ I tell her. â€œMaybe I am.â€
Much later in the story, Christina is having a deep conversation with Andy about life and their expectations.
â€I supposed I just wantedâ€¦â€ To be loved, I almost blurt. But Iâ€™m ashamed to say it. â€œA normal life, I guess.â€
Andy sighs. â€œWell, thatâ€™s the problem, isnâ€™t it? Look, I donâ€™t mean to be rude, but you could never have a normal life, even if thatâ€™s what you thought you wanted. You and me, weâ€™re not â€˜normal.â€™ We donâ€™t fit into conventional boxes.â€
Those two scenes were some of the moments when I felt like I understood the characters the most. I could relate to how Christina felt, particularly feeling or knowing that youâ€™re unconventional. When you look at the people around you, you see that they fit neatly inside that conventional box and you canâ€™t shove yourself inside of it no matter how hard you try. It's like mourning for a life that was never meant to be yours. Feeling bitter and angry at times. Sometimes, all you can manage to do is drift around through life in a leaky boat and hope that it doesnâ€™t sink.
My only complaint is the length. The story itself in the hardback edition is only 296 pages and then there were several pages of author's notes and acknowledgements. Donâ€™t get me wrong, a lot happens in that short time and itâ€™s a satisfying story, but part of me wanted more. Actually, I was surprised that so much happens in such a short novel. Good and bad things. Also, this story has a lot of depth.
Overall, I loved this story, the characters, and the writing. If youâ€™re looking for a solid historical fiction novel, this is it. (less)",Positif

Tara Sivec brings the feels again with The Story of Us, an emotional second chance romance between a soldier and his first love â€“ a young couple that were heartbreakingly torn apart only to be unexpectedly reunited years later, both damaged and scarred. A surprising, dramatic and heartfelt story that is beautifully romantic and left me feeling all fluffy with a big grin on my face.
Iâ€™m broken and scarred and half the man I used to be, but if sheâ€™ll let me explain, I hope to God she can put me back together again.
Elijah and Shelby met as teenagers. She was the privileged princess, he worked in her familyâ€™s stables, she crushed on him, he wasnâ€™t interested. It wasnâ€™t until Shelby returned from college that Eli finally noticed her, and over the course of one blissful summer, the two of them fell into a deep, intense, all-consuming love. They were torn apart when Eli was shipped off on deployment, and lies and betrayal set their lives in completely different paths.
Eliâ€™s deployment ended in tragedy when he was taken prisoner, but everybody back at home was told he was dead. For five years he was held and tortured, and his dreams of Shelby were the only thing that got him through. Now that heâ€™s free, he has one thing on his mind â€“ going home and getting his girl back.
Iâ€™ve waited long enough. Shelby is the main reason Iâ€™m still here, alive and kicking, and itâ€™s time she knows that. Itâ€™s time for me to take back what was always meant to be mine.
I loved Eli. His strength in enduring all that he has, and then his determination to reclaim his life and get his girl back was amazing, and I loved his alphaness in going after what he wanted. But the girl he finds is far from what he expected, and Shelby is now a shadow of the wild girl with big dreams that she used to be. The five years that she spent thinking that Eli was dead, and all that happened to her in that time has left her completely changed, and Eli is determined to bring her back.
â€œYou saved me, Shelby,â€ I whisper, pressing my forehead against hers. â€œFor five years, you saved me, and you didnâ€™t even know it. Now itâ€™s my turn to save you.â€
OMG, this is such a beautiful love story. Heartbreaking, emotional, passionate and full of chemistry, I could feel everything between Eli and Shelby. Their love for each other is evident in every moment between them, but there is more to their separation than either of them knew and their reunion is not an easy one, and things get quite angsty with both of them holding onto secrets. Iâ€™ve gotta say, I was frustrated that it took them so long to truly talk to each other, but they do eventually open up and confront the demons of their past and work through the issues that are facing them in the present. And through it all there is a feeling of certainty that they belong together, that they need each other to be able to find peace, be happy and move forward, and I loved watching them fight to find that.
â€œI canâ€™t leave you alone and I canâ€™t move on because youâ€™re everything to me. You always have been and you always will be, and I know damn well you feel the same, even if you want to stand here, look me right in the fucking eyes, and lie to me.â€
â€¦
â€œI donâ€™t give a shit if youâ€™re with someone else, heâ€™ll never love you the way I do. Heâ€™ll never fight for you the way I do and heâ€™ll never fucking see you the way I do!â€
There is some drama as secrets are fully revealed and finally dealt with, and there were some great surprises in the way their story unfolded, which I really enjoyed. And as gorgeous as the love story is, this book is also a journey of two people finding themselves again after enduring heartache, trauma, loss and grief, and that part of the story blended beautifully with the romance.
â€œIâ€™d rather be a complete mess with you than spend another day shattered all over the floor alone.â€
This was a beautifully written story. I loved the characters, I loved the romance, and loved their story â€“ including the glimpses we got into their past together and the way that was woven into the book. This was a surprising read with lots of feels, and I loved it.
4 stars.

,"Science Fiction, Mystery, Fiction, Dystopia, Apocalyptic",thefourthvine,"This book was betrayed by its marketing. This is not dystopian, and thereâ€™s no exposing the cracks in the foundation of society, and anyone who reads it hoping for that grim Handmaidâ€™s Tale action is going to be incredibly disappointed. Meanwhile, people like me, who donâ€™t like that stuff but would really enjoy this book, are driven away. I was almost driven away, but Iâ€™m glad I gave this book a shot.
What it actually is hopeful post-apocalyptic fiction. Yeah, there was an apocalypse â€” not one big dramatic one, but basically the accumulation of disasters and attrition over a period of years â€” but that was 100 years ago, and society recovered. The technological level has fallen, but not evenly or completely; they still have solar panels and some tools and birth control implants. The last is really important to the book â€” every woman (or, well, it should be uterus-haver, but this is NOT a gender-variance-friendly book) gets an implant, and only removes it once their household has proven that it can support a baby and is given a banner, which signifies the right to have a child.
The society in this is not dystopian at all, nor is it utopian. Itâ€™s just a different way of organizing people. In that, it reminds me in some ways of New York 2140, albeit with a much lower technology level (and with much less focus on the details of living; one thing Robinson does not really address is child-having or child-rearing or really families much at all). This society is more communal, with minimal focus on the nuclear family unit (instead, the base unit is the household, which is built in various ways, but not really ever with just a nuclear family), and way more interdependence in communities. The focus on everyone helping, everyone doing their bit, is intense. And it also very much drives the plot.
And as for the cracks in society â€” nope, those arenâ€™t exposed, either. If anything, this book is about the relative resilience of this society. Sure, the mystery involves some people being selfish and working the system in their favor, but thatâ€™s just humans being humans. In the end, the problem is dealt with, and the society continues on.
I really enjoyed this book. Not so much because of the mystery, which is, shall we say, not exactly a challenge to solve, but because of the worldbuilding, and because of the characters that inhabit this world. I especially liked Enid, but honestly most of the characters were interesting and likable both.
This book struck me as inherently hopeful and kind. It was not just a compelling read but a *pleasant* one. And thatâ€™s why the summary copy stuns me â€” this book is exactly the opposite of what it says on the tin. (less)",Positif

When The Man in the Black Suit, the new standalone romantic suspense from Sylvain Reynard, hit our Kindles, we knew immediately, it had to be our next read! Weâ€™ve always found this author to be a master storyteller, with a passion for art, landscape and words which is beautifully crafted and conveyed through his stories, as he captivates and immerses us into his world.
Sylvain Reynard states he is â€œinterested in how aesthetic elements such as art, architecture, and music can be used to tell a story or to illuminate the traits of a particular characterâ€¦â€ and it shows! His passion is without question, as he draws us into the story with his impressive and visually resplendent world building, creating a setting that feels so real, itâ€™s as though weâ€™re witnessing the majesty of the scenery and the beauty of the surroundings first hand through the eyes of the characters.
â€œHow can you love me?â€ Nicholas whispered
â€œHow could I not?â€
A thrilling and painful quest for revenge, and a need for justice provides the background for Acacia Santos and Nicholas Cassirerâ€™s love story. Both from very different worlds, yet with an underlying thread that would see their worlds collide with action packed, emotional and heart stopping consequences.
Acacia Santos, a strong, intelligent statuesque Brazilian beauty who longed for honesty and intimacy, was a fabulous kick arse heroine and a perfect match for the commanding and mysterious Nicholas. She more than matched wills with him on many levels and it was exceptional to witness!
â€œYou have my heart, Nicholas. I donâ€™t want it back.â€
Nicholas Cassirer, oh be still our beating swoony hearts! Nicholas was an imposing, masculine world wise man cloaked in a shroud of mystery and secrecy who kept us guessing right up until the very end. Who was he and how did he wield such power and maintain such influential contacts?
â€œI like to hear you laugh.â€ Nicholas tightened his hold and brought her chest again his. â€œLook at those eyes. A man could get lost in those.â€
We couldnâ€™t put this book down, consistently held captive by Acacia Santos and Nicholas Cassirerâ€™s thrilling, passionate, intoxicating, poignant, suspenseful and heart grippingly romantic story. We devoured every word, becoming agitated when real life demanded our attention, eagerly counting the hours until we could once again return to their heart stopping action packed quest.
â€œThis is worth fighting for,â€ he groaned
â€œYes.â€
Everything you need to know about The Man in the Black Suit is in the synopsis. All the elements we mentioned above need to be uncovered and experienced by sinking between the pages of this book. Oh, and, Hollywood needs to snap this book up! What a magnificent movie this would make!
â€˜I love this man. I can see his heart and soul in his eyes, and I donâ€™t ever want to be without them.â€™
Sylvain Reynard beautifully builds this story, testing us, teasing us, engaging us and taunting us with his poetic words, thrilling and suspenseful storytelling and strong likeable characters, whilst integrating current world affairs into the mix, and in doing so, sending a powerful message and food for thought.
The chemistry sizzles, the mystery fascinates, the story never became over dramatized, maintaining a pace that held us transfixed from start to finish! What a read indeed from an author who never disappoints.
â€œYou always take my breath away.â€

Although prior to reading In the Great Green Room I knew nothing of the author of Goodnight Moon, now I will never be able to forget the name Margaret Wise Brown. Margaretâ€™s personality danced vivaciously across the pages and the conveyance of her sense of adventure was palpable. The smooth flowing narrative allowed for an entertaining read that was not forced. Amy Gary was able to portray Margaretâ€™s highs and lows in a way that is relatable to all readers. The extensiveness of Garyâ€™s research provides for a fascinating and thorough description of a bold, valiant life, hard to contain in 300 pages.

Yet again, I find myself at the end of a book that I really enjoyed that I can't really tell you about because-spoilers.
Lots of the stupid spoiler things happen in this book. They make for a great book... but a boring review.
So, stuff happens. And there's a ""Hold on, WHAT?!?!?"" cliffhanger. And some hot sex. That was in there.
Brandon and Carly...well, Bran are great together and the author tells not only a continuation of the murder mystery from the first book but also their romance.

This book started off and got all the way past the middle mark with really great character development and slow (maybe, just slightly a little too slow) burn. Everett was just a little too clueless and Gage was just a little too clued in and Nash just seemed to refuse to engage, but it was working for me. Then practically overnight, all of a sudden everyone is in love and settling into a secret M/M/M relationship. I was also super annoyed with the super convenient guest that showed up to solve all the misunderstandings between Everett and Reese. C'mon. Really? Not to mention how Everett met Ronan was unbelievable to me.
I was actually gearing up to write a review that said I really liked that the formula of guns and danger was not a big part of this story but then in the last few chapters, we suddenly have to have implausible violence.
IDK. I liked these characters better than the last few but I never could see Gage as a cold hearted killer or merc/vigilante for Ronan. And the super f*cked up back story for Gage was totally predictable -- not the actual events, but that he had one -- all the Protectors books have them it seems. Nobody can want revenge unless the crime is heinous and incomprehensible.
Last thing, the notes at the end of the book mention she is crossing over with the Lucy Lennox, Made Marion series, I don't know if this means they will be writing together or just sharing worlds but this does not excite me. These books and series are hard enough to keep track of, half the time I have to go back and figure out who is who, but to now throw in a whole other series with characters and worlds that I was not a fan of, just makes me wonder how much more effort I want to put into this universe.

It's over and I WANT MOAR!
I remember picking the first book of the series, Traitor's Blade, roughly a year ago. I went into it and, to be perfectly candid, I wasn't really expecting too much. I was like ""Ok, nice cover. This might be at least decent. Hopefully."" Boy, was I wrong! The book turned out to be an extremely satisfying read. There were badassery aplenty, a good shot of humour, rapiers, saints and an ending that wasn't a bastard of a cliffhanger. So I went out and got myself book #2, Knight's Shadow. Once again, de Castell left me baffled because shit had taken a sharp turn with the story going full grimdark (and I mean that in the best possible way). Saint's Blood followed the same path and, once again, I loved the muthafuck'n' shite out of the book.
Now this. There's no way I can tell how ""Tyrant's Throne"" blew my mind without going into spoiler mode. Get this, something happens halfway through. And it's something that's going to rip your heart out. The ending? Oh, no issues there, it is just the way it's supposed to be: perfect.

THE REVIEW
Why this book?
I love this series
What I thought
This book was just plain awesome, but of course it was the whole series is awesome! I love Charley and all her shenanigans and Reyes and gang. It kills me every year to wait and see what they're going to be up to next. So much stuff happened in this book and so much is brought to light. There is never a dull moment. I liked how this book didn't feel as dark as the last two did and how the characters always surprise me. The plot was also really good, investigating cults and perverts all in the life of Charley Davidson. Definitely a perfect addition to the series.
""Is there anything else you want to share?"" ""Anything you think of I should be aware of?""
""No"" I shook my head in thought "" Not especially. Unless you count the fact that I'm going to take over the world.""
""The whole thing?""
""Well,i'm going to try to take over the world.""
""And you feel you're prepared for world domination?""
I lifted a noncommittal shoulder ""I'm taking a business class""

This book was a solid 4.5 stars for me.
I have really been wanting to read The Dishonorable Miss DeLancey for a while. I had previously heard about the writing of Carolyn Miller. Many people seem to really enjoy reading her books. So I thought I would give this book a go! Boy, did she not disappoint. I really believe the hype about this author is actually warranted for a change.
The characters in her novels feel so real and multi-dimensional, that I sometimes forget that I am just reading a novel. I love that her writing is captivating and so very engaging. Before I get into this book I do want to put a disclaimer out there that I did not have a chance to read her first two books in the Regency Brides series. I do plan on reading them in the future. I did enjoy this book but recommend you read the first two as the characters are revisited and you sometimes need context for scenes.
While this is a Christian fiction novel, I felt that it could be enjoyed by readers of faith and those of other belief systems. The story has a great moral purpose too it, which is something I really look for when reading faith-inspired books.
This book follows Miss Claire DeLancey, who is a mysterious character. She could be a villain or she could be a hero, it is rather hard to tell at the beginning of the novel. The book seems to imply she is a rather villainous woman. I found the character growth in this book to be some of the best I have ever read. I really began to enjoy Claire's character before the middle of the book.
The themes of this book are very interesting indeed. They include finding yourself, trusting God, forgiveness, redemption, finding a purpose, and relationships. I really feel like these various aspects just made this a great book.
This is a super clean book. I will put a disclaimer out there that The Dishonorable Miss DeLancey does contain a scene about potentially contemplating suicide, a scene where a woman is taken advantage of. There is some gambling. All of these are serious topics but are well done and not over the top.
I can't recommend this book enough. I really think you should check out this book. This is a quick fast paced book. It will be an instant classic for fans of the Historical Fiction novel.

I enjoyed this - hence the four-star rating - but I couldn't escape the feeling that the editor should have wielded his/her red pen with the same efficiency as Zachary or Karigan wield their swords, and if s/he had, then the book would have been about 200 pages shorter and the narrative a lot tighter. I also found that things tended to wrap up a bit too neatly and easily.

â€œJust for the record: happiness is not bullshit.â€
I picked up Less for one reason and one reason alone . . . . .
â€œYou won?â€
â€œItâ€™s not Pew-lit-sir. Itâ€™s Pull-it-sir. Holy fuck, Arthur, I won.â€
Occasionally I like to prove that I donâ€™t live on porn and murder alone and venture out. The world of award winners has generally worked out pretty well for me and, although Iâ€™m not a zealot about it, I try to squeeze in a Pulitzer, Man Booker or Edgar Award winner a couple times a year.
The story here is about Arthur Less. Quickly approaching 50 with one former partner dying and another getting married, Arthur feels he has no choice but to do one thing . . . .
Except the staying in more part. No, on the contrary Arthur will be going out more. A lot more. And all over the world. From Paris to Berlin to Morocco, Arthur will become quite the globetrotter in order to avoid facing the facts that heâ€™s not getting any younger . . . or more successful . . . or better at relationships.
Less has the hardware that proves unarguably that I read it wrong. I donâ€™t even have a valid reason, either, because the â€œoff the top of my headâ€ excuse why I didnâ€™t fall over myself loving this one is that I didnâ€™t really relate to Arthur. Obviously I canâ€™t truly relate to all of the meth manufacturers, moonshine runners, cannibals and serial killers who manage to make their way into my cold, dead heart either, so like I said â€“ invalid argument. I guess my main problem with poor Arthur was . . . .
â€œYou talk like a child. You look and act very young.â€ . . . â€œMaybe you never grew up.â€ Maybe he never did.

,"Christian Fiction, Fiction, Contemporary, Christian",Heidi Robbins (Heidi Reads...),"Wow. There are so many things I thought about while I read this book. Surprisingly, I didn't cry (which I tend to do with books dealing with grief), but felt very introspective. I think that's due to Autumn's detached observations, her coping mechanisms, and the deep questions she and other characters wrestled with. The book started a bit slow for me as things began to unfold and be revealed, but the pace steadily picked up and I appreciated the time I was able to take with each level of Autumn's reemergence into a functioning life. The part that hit home to me personally was when Paul was reflecting on how his children had grown. It made me think of my relationship with my own 10 year old daughter and how I can preserve our bond and sense of unity that seems to come so naturally when they are younger.
""There were moments when Reese still seemed so young and innocent, but even more moments like the one he experienced with Tate as he carried him up the stairs, only instead of her weight or height catching him off guard, it was her... apartness. There were more and more pieces of his daughter that were becoming a mystery to him. It filled Paul with the same sense of alarm that it had with Tate. The same sense that if he didn't grab something quick, this monumentally important thing would slip away.""
The book explores many angles of the timeless question of why bad things happen, or why God allows bad things to happen. The thoughts and processes of the characters were natural and realistic, and I loved the profound conclusions they came to as they interacted with each other and learned from the insights shared. Autumn's developing relationship with the Elliot family brought light and hope to her, them, and to the overall story. I especially enjoyed 6 year old Tate and his mannerisms- he practically jumped off the page! I didn't expect a romance to come out of the circumstances, so it was a pleasant surprise, especially when I wasn't sure if I should be rooting for Seth, Autumn's former fiancee, or Paul, who was dealing with more baggage than he could handle. The extended family of Autumn and Paul play important roles that illustrate the variety of family situations, the imperfections, and the love and loyalty we share in spite of it. The way the author wove so many aspects and themes together is beautiful and I highly recommend this novel!

There is no end to the twists, tension, and wedding drama, woven throughout with Liza and Connor's faith journeys and their journey as a couple.

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction, War, World War II, Cultural, Germany",Melissa,"*3.75-ish stars (rounded up)*
The Women in the Castle is a riveting novel that hits home with the notion that sometimes itâ€™s our shared experiencesâ€”no matter how horrificâ€”rather than our strongly-held beliefs or common views of the world, that can bind us together and leave a lasting impression.
Jessica Shattuck takes a different approach with her WWII story, opting to relay the devastation through the eyes of three distinct German women. Women that stumble and make mistakes along the way, like we all do, but ultimately strive to find some semblance of a life among the scattered ruins of their bleak existence and the memories of the awful things they witnessed throughout the war; not to mention, the things they were forced to sacrifice. Flat and borderline lifeless, it was more the pity and heartbreak I felt on behalf of these characters than any sort of likability, that kept me interested in their story.
Almost a character in and of itself, Burg Ligenfels, a remote and decrepit Bavarian castle, opens and closes the doors on these women and their journey to peace. It all starts with a party in 1938, held at the castle, where Marianneâ€™s husband, Albrecht, and her best-friend, Connie, decide itâ€™s time to take a stand against Hitler, consequences be damned. Itâ€™s at the same party Marianne vows, unbeknownst to them, to take care of the wives and children of the resistance.
Fast forward, years after the war and now a widow herself, Marianne is taking her role as pseudo-resistance mother seriously. Despite her determination, she only manages to track down Connieâ€™s widow, Benita, and the widow of another resister, Ania. The three women, along with their children, settle into Burg Ligenfels and become somewhat of a makeshift family. Things arenâ€™t easy though; their relationships are weighed down by guilt, lies and Marianneâ€™s unwavering beliefs.
As compelling as I found this story to be, it wasnâ€™t without its faults. The author skips huge chunks of time and tries to make up for it by going back and filling in some of the blanks along the way, but the delivery is muddled and often confusing. There were quite a few times I had to straighten out the timeline in my own head and figure out whose voice which particular chapter pertained to before I could move on. Around PART III, I felt the story lost a great deal of momentum and teetered on the edge of boring. The author gave up the few secrets she held quite easily and too early on, making the ending less impactful, in my opinion. Acceptable and peaceful in some ways, but lacking the strong emotional edge I expected from a story of this calibre.
While I enjoyed this book, it didn't come close to dethroning The Nightingale, the most remarkable WWII story I have ever read, from the mighty pedestal I've placed it on. The women in this story aren't as emotionally adept or as memorable as I found the characters from Sarah's Key to be either. For the different take this story provides on WWII, I would say it's worth the read and would even go so far to say it's on par with All the Light We Cannot See. It's one I'm glad I took the time to read, but not one I would consider a new favorite in this genre.

Cody is really well defined as person.
Hayden has a lot of traits like backing, loving math, and having a bad break up but a lot of this seems surface level and he never feels as developed as a character.

This book starts with a thrilling exciting scene; we witness a very shocking scene that will mark Edie and John's life. Edie is having a girl's night with her best friend; they decide to run to the gas station for candy and all the good essential a girl needs for a movie night. She never could have imagined that a normal night would end up changing her life entirely. The events of that night hunted her dreams every night; to top it off school was becoming more and more intolerable. Edie was fed up with all the years being bullied and she finally steps up for herself.
""In life, unless you're willing to run away and live in the woods and risk being eaten by bears, some things just were unavoidable.""
John Cole; meets Edie the ugly night were both of their lives were in someone else's hands. That night will be one he most definably would never forget. Ever since, he decided to change how he was living and decides to get better grades and get a job. He soon discovers that Edie had transferred to his public school recently after that night.
John and Edie have more in common then what they think. Where Edie is tortured by bullies due to her weight, John is the popular one and good looking. The experience of that night has brought them together now and they seem to understand each other so much so then they could have imagined. After realizing they share English class together; they start to develop a very close friendship. I particular loved this book for that reason. Their friendship felt so real and fantastic; John was ahhhhh he was dreamy, protected and he seemed genuine to me. He would understand and knew exactly what Edie needed without her telling him. With John, Edie was able to enjoy herself without feeling uncomfortable. He made her feel normal. She couldn't understand that someone with such a great popularity and great looking could even notice her even as a friend.
â€œHe was beautiful and I . . . I was nothing. An out-of-her-depth girl who wore too much black and feared the bulk of society.â€
I must admit I wanted to feel lots of butterflies with these two but I just didn't. The chemistry was not there it was mainly friendship up until much later towards the end of the book. I almost wished they would have dated differently too; like I felt they were both pushed into the boyfriend/girlfriend relationship card, so it took me forever to actually warm up to the idea of them dating. Still I really enjoyed the story; the side characters were fantastic. John was such an amazing hero; I loved how protected he was and how he cared for Edie. The story is full of sarcasm, funny scenes, and it will be appealing to readers who enjoy young adult high school stories.

Oh, how I wanted to love this book. The Last Magician has a fantastic premise, and I hoped that this one would become a new favorite.
But it didn't.
I was...slightly disappointed by this? Don't get me wrong, this book was enjoyable and wholly decent. However, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to be desired in this story.
In The Last Magician, we follow Esta, our leading lady who lives in present day New York City and steals ancient magical artifacts for a mysterious professor. Unknown to us normal folk, mageus (or people with magical abilities) live among society in secret, and Esta has the power to jump backward through time. And in this world where magic users exist, a magical barrier called the Brink has locked in the mageus of Long Island for centuries. The Order is out to squash the last of the mageus into oblivion, and the only hope for the future is Esta: at the beginning of the story, she's tasked with travelling backward in time to 1902, to steal an ancient book that will be the key to saving the world.
And to do this, she must infiltrate Dolph Saunders' gang, the most notorious crime boss in all of New York City.
Sounds amazing, right?!
Yeah, it was...fine. But nothing special.
Lisa Maxwell had a lot of great ideas for The Last Magician, but many of them were executed with minimal effort. For instance: Esta can travel back in time thanks to her magical abilities, and because of this, she's tasked with infiltrating Dolph Saunder's gang in 1902. Dolph is set up to be this badass, morally ambiguous crime boss with a dark past, and I liked his introduction into the story. However, Maxwell never fully developed Esta's friendships with Dolph and his gang.
I felt throughout a majority of this book that the characters were merely tolerating one another, and I never bought their relationships. It left me feeling hollow. Why should I care about these characters if they don't care about each other?
Some of the side characters were pretty interesting, but incredibly underdeveloped. I would've liked to have learned more about Jianyu; he was so cool!
Esta and Harte were the only characters in The Last Magician that were given considerable development, and because of that, I really enjoyed them and their relationship. Their romance was...actually pretty sexy. Not gonna lie, some of the romantic moments in here were really well-written and had my heart-racing. These two definitely had great chemistry.
If more of the characters were developed with the amount of care that Harte and Esta were, I think I would've loved this book a lot more.
Also, Maxwell really utilizes the time period in this book. It's glitzy and glamorous, but also dark and fully of mystery. It's apparent the author did a lot of research going into this book, and the historical setting of turn-of-the-century New York City imbued with magic was well-done here. Even though magic is not fully explained in this book, you get a sense that this world has known of its existence for centuries.
While I understand that Esta being from the future is supposed to heighten the drama and tension, her reasons for needing to get back to the present, besides returning the magical book to her mentor, were pretty flimsy. I didn't buy her familial bonds with anyone in the present day, so I didn't care whether she made it back or not.
Also, this book is long. Way longer than it probably should've been. I was pulled into this book because of its premise, and I was so excited for the big heist that was promised. However, much more time was spent on other elements of the story that didn't need to be. If Maxwell had tightened up the pacing of this book, and developed interesting, believable relationships among the MCs and side-characters, this book would've been awesome. As it stands, there were parts of this book that I really enjoyed (Harte's magic shows were great.), but the elements that I wanted to love were lacking.
I enjoyed this book. Really, I did. But my high expectations, paired with the fact that everyone but me really seems to love this book, had me feeling a little underwhelmed towards the end. Will I read the next book? I'm not sure yet.
Overall, The Last Magician was enjoyable, but nowhere near as good as I wanted it to be. (less)",Positif

Gosh, this was so relatable!
Pretty sure you all know what this is about, but just in case you don't, it's about Eliza and her world. The Sea Monsters. The fandom she's created and chose to write anonymously about. Her art. Which in turn becomes her life. She's more active online than she is in the real world. She's more herself online, more at ease and anything outside of that bubble makes her uncomfortable, agitated and feel slightly overwhelmed.
I mean, I related to this on a spiritual level.
It did take me almost half-way to fully connect with it, but from then on, I was falling in love with it deeper and deeper. Page by page. Eliza is such a wonderful character. Her journey throughout all of this - which I'll leave out since YOU SHOULD GO AND DISCOVER IT AND READ IT - was intense, and agonising and healing to follow. I adored it! I understood her and I felt like I was uncovering parts of myself to myself.
Whilst reading, there were moments of just intense connection. â€˜Yes, I understand your anxiety. I know why you want to hide. I empathise with how you want to escape reality all the time and crawl into your safe space, because happiness resides there.â€™ It just felt all so enlightening.
I smiled, laughed, teared up and felt the hurt through Zappia's words. The ending did feel slightly rushed. Or maybe I didn't want it to end and was craving for more, but I can absolutely see myself reading this again. When this pain heals that it.

What I love about Mia Sheridanâ€™s romances is that there is a fated, larger-than-life feel to the love stories. I get swept away whollyâ€¦ into the conflicts, the heartbreaks, the longing, the tears and the eventual emotional surrender of two people meant to spend their lives together. I felt taken once again with Prestonâ€™s Honorâ€”the story of two friends with vastly different upbringings, whose love for each other grew through the years. But their feelings were hidden, lost by what was left unsaid, thwarted by good intentions and reckless promises between brothers.
â€œI gave her up for the honor between us, the honor I tried so hard to hold on to despite my feelings.â€
We meet Annalia, the daughter of a poor migrant worker, a girl who grew up unwanted, but who loved the escape of playing with the Sawyer boys, twins Preston and Cole. Even as teenagers, Annalia (Lia) and Preston secretly longed for each otherâ€™s affection. But a brotherâ€™s promise kept Preston away from Lia, opening the door to misunderstanding and heartache.

To hell with anything that didnâ€™t involve my lips on Liaâ€™s and the proclamation that she was mine, that sheâ€™d always been mine, regardless of contests or a spit-wet handshake, or even my palm on a Bible and the eyes of a thousand people bearing witness to a sworn oath.â€
But one night, their emotions best their good intentions, and they collide with all the pent-up lust, love and longing they felt. Unfortunately, those moments of bliss unleash a tragic chain of events that would change everything.
Months after struggling with a life that should have been heaven, Lia leaves Preston and her new baby behind without word or reason. Each fighting a wave of despair, grief and hopelessness that would breed resentment.
Six months later, Lia is back, intent on reclaiming her life and those she loved. But after everything thatâ€™s happened, she returns to a Preston whoâ€™s hardened after the struggles heâ€™s faced without her. Itâ€™s a gut punch for both of them.
â€œI needed to come to terms with the fact that Lia had always been my weak spot, and apparently even after her betrayal, that hadnâ€™t changed.â€
Through flashbacks from the past intermingled with the present, Lia and Preston begin to open up to each other in ways they never had, to see if they can heal and have a life together.
â€œMy heart, it seemed, knew only how to beat for him, like the wings of a bird soaring through an endless sky. As blue as his eyes and as warm as his touch had once been on my skin.â€
With so many poignant moments, you canâ€™t help but be swept away by Lia and Prestonâ€™s story. So much passion, such depth of feeling evoked by Miaâ€™s thoughtful prose. If youâ€™re looking to get lost in a story that just makes you feel and feel and feel, Prestonâ€™s Honor is the perfect escape.

,"Young Adult, Contemporary, Fiction",Cynthia (Bingeing On Books),"I received this ARC from NetGalley in exchange for my honest review.
Wow. What an incredibly powerful and emotional book. Moonbeam has spent most of her life with a religious cult. The book starts with a fire at the compound and a fight between its residents and the Government, whom the leader always said was out to get them. Moonbeam then spends time at a facility, where she describes her life to a psychiatrist and an FBI agent and she has group interactions with fellow survivors. The therapy was so well done and I loved the character of Moonbeam. She is sarcastic and spunky and so incredibly strong. It was fascinating to see some of the things that were taught and reasons why she believed those things. The author did a great job of focusing on the reasons why someone could believe religious fanatics behind cults or the ways the leaders are able to keep the members under control and he did this without sensationalizing everything. Moonbeam showed so much growth throughout this book and the therapy sessions and it was heartbreaking at times to see her realize her entire life had been a lie. This was an incredibly well written book that I just could not put down. Five star read for sure! (less)",Positif
,"Fiction, Contemporary, Cultural, Literature ",G.H. Eckel,"Most people love this novel and I see why. The writing is good, the characters interact intimately, and all of us have been through the ups and downs of a relationship. What didn't work for me was the story line, which has to do with me not the novel. An older, married couple find themselves in an empty nest. He's alcoholic and dependent on her. She's decided to devote herself to religion because of a deal she cut with God 25 years ago. They're on vacation and she decides she wants to join a sisterhood, meaning, adios alcoholic husband. So, the meat of the book is the wife's displeasure with the husband. They're on a four day break, a midwinter break, when the prospect of divorce comes to the forefront. The only drama in the book then is will she or will she not leave him.
I won't give away the answer but I guess, for me, although there are wonderful points of togetherness, there are far more moments of the wife belittling the husband and the husband being a turd by failing to take control of his actions. So, the pain of a marriage on the rocks is not an exciting topic for me. I ended up not being sympathetic toward the alcoholic or the nasty wife. We've all been through impossible times in relationships and, for some of us, those relationships have not survived. So, as readers, we get it and follow along. But it was a painful read for me. Again, that's just me, not the novel. The majority of readers have enjoyed this failing relationship and found truth in the ugliness. So, you'll probably like the novel; it's just not my favorite topic.

,"Romance, Christian, Mystery, Suspense, Fiction ",Diane,"Thank you to NetGalley for allowing me to read an advanced copy of Weavers Needle for an honest review.
Weavers Needle by author Robin Caroll is based on the legend of the Dutchmanâ€™s Lost mine in Arizona, USA. This area has many mysteries and disappearances of those who cross the rugged terrain in search for hidden gold within the Superstition mountain area.
As the book progressed I was intrigued to read the Native American aspect of history for that area. The Apache Shamans wanted to stop intruders to their sacred mountain. The gold was not to be used for the white man or people. It was to be kept safely within the mountain for the Thunder God. There is a very spiritual theme to this book which I found so interesting. The story also has a Christian faith based theme which the author delicately and very skillfully worked into the events which affect the main characters, Landry and Nickolai. I wonâ€™t post spoilers, but will let you know I very much enjoyed this book!
Landry Parker is an ex-Army MP who has been continuing her fathers â€œRecoveryâ€ business in New Orleans since his death. Now the business is in financial peril and she is desperate to earn enough money fast to put her business back on a solid financial foundation. Landry is good at her job, she learned how to find lost or hidden art, people, and collectibles as she worked with her father.
Her new client is offering a fifty thousand dollar recovery fee for a lost document. The document was stolen from her husband after he was murdered. Landry is not hired to solve the case or find who is responsible for Mr. Winsletâ€™s murder, but to find an original document dating from around the 1850â€™s which was said to be the dying instructions of Weaver on how to find the legendary cache of gold in the Superstition mountain. Before the meeting with Mrs. Winslet starts, another person is admitted into the room. The search is to be a competition between Landry and another PI, named Nickolai Baptiste, if they both agree to take the case. They do not like this arrangement, but they both are in need of money. Nickolai is an ex police officer who needs the money to pay for the additional care for his troubled sister.
So, if you enjoy a bit of history, a bit of mystery, a bit of spiritual intrigue, with a hint of romanceâ€¦this is a must read!
Great writing, Robin Caroll! (less)",Positif
,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction, English History, Tudor Period",Hannah Greendale,"Click here to watch a video review of this book on my channel, From Beginning to Bookend.
Anne Boleyn is eleven-years-old when she leaves her noble English familyâ€™s estate to serve at the royal court of the Netherlands. She is shuffled from one estate to another before her ambitious father arranges for Anne to work as a maiden to Queen Katherine, wife of Henry VIII. Before long, Anne inadvertently catches Henryâ€™s eye, who begs her to be his mistress. Though she initially spurns his advances, he remains persistent and Anne soon realizes his affections could be worked to improve her status and that of her family. Anne decides to play along, unaware that her machinations will be the cause of her undoing.
Anne Boleyn: A Kingâ€™s Obsession is the second book in the Six Tudor Queens series (in which each book is dedicated to recounting the life of one of King Henry VIIIâ€™s wives). Spanning from 1512 to 1536, Anneâ€™s life is examined from the time when she is eleven years of age living in her familyâ€™s Hever Castle to the moment when the light of life leaves her eyes forever.
Because Henry VIII courts Anne Boleyn while heâ€™s still married to Queen Katherine, some of Anneâ€™s story overlaps with events from the first book in the series, Katherine of Aragon: The True Queen . Having read books one and two back-to-back, the intermittent overlap was evident but caused minimal irritation, due in large part to the intrigue of the events being recounted from Anneâ€™s perspective.
Based on decades of extensive research, Weir gives one interpretation of Anne Boleynâ€™s life, charting her transformation from a demure and obedient girl to an empowered, free-thinking adult woman. When Anne sets off for the Netherlands at the age of eleven, she is imbued with the understanding that her life will always be ruled by men.
Anne and her brothers and sister had been brought up to render unconditional obedience [to their father]. When she and [her sister] married, their husbands would take over this role. It had been drummed into them both that women were weak creatures and should always be subject to the wise dominion of men.
However, while working in the Netherlands, and later in France, Anne is influenced by her progressive female employers. Encouraged to think for herself, and given access to literature penned by feminist author, Christine de Pizan, Anne adopts unconventional attitudes about the roles of men and women.
It was wrong, surely, that men had the right to make women take husbands against their will. She would never let anyone force her into marriage!
No, she would never let [a man take advantage of her]. No man would have the chance. In fact, she was resolved never to have anything to do with the perfidious, dangerous, bestial creatures.
In due time, Anne grows to be a sophisticated young woman. She becomes â€œaware of her budding figure and the admiring glances of the young menâ€ and learns how to â€œflash her dark eyes, swish her skirt or sway her hips to effect.â€ As her body becomes more womanly, Anne is delighted to realize that she can enjoy â€œmastery over the opposite sexâ€ by shrewdly employing her own sexual prowess to her advantage. Nonetheless, she carefully guards her virtue, determined to never â€œallow a man to make a fool of her.â€
Try as she might to retain a sense of autonomy, Anne falls in love and, in giving her heart to another, inadvertently weakens her resolve. When her affections are twisted by another for the purpose of political gain, Anneâ€™s heart is shattered and she is permanently hardened by the experience.
She wished, how she wished, that she had given a better account of herself, put (view spoiler) in his place, exposed him for what he was. But her moment would come. She did not know when or how, but she and her family would see him brought down. She had vowed it. He would suffer, as he had made her suffer.
Anneâ€™s broken heart is not yet mended when Henry VIII begins his advances, which she initially rejects: â€œYour wife I cannot be, both in respect of my unworthiness, and also because you have a wife already. Your mistress I will not be!â€ However, Henry is relentless and Anne eventually arrives at a shrewd conclusion:
(view spoiler)
Thus, Weir examines one of historyâ€™s greatest mysterious: Henry VIII loved Anne Boleyn (as is evident by his letters), but did Anne love Henry?
Though concern has been raised that Weirâ€™s negative opinions of Anne Boleyn will taint the narrative, Anne is given a fair portrayal. In fact, after being accused in Katherine of Aragon of committing offensive acts, (view spoiler).
Much like in Katherine of Aragon: The True Queen, this book slows at about the two-thirds mark, but it picks up again in Part Four when Anne finds herself accused of (view spoiler).
Anneâ€™s story concludes with a final paragraph that is eloquent yet deeply unsettling â€“ a memorable conclusion if ever there was one.
Anne Boleyn: A Kingâ€™s Obsession is a skillfully crafted coming-of-age story that proves an engaging exploration of an enigmatic historical figureâ€™s life (and death). (less)",Positif
,"Fiction, Historical, Historical Fiction, Literary Fiction, Native Americans, Adult",Travel Writing,"There are so many excellent Native American writers. Why bother read a book about Native Americans written by a white woman, who was raised as a white kid in Apartheid. She was raised in the oppressor class, you get that right? She was raised entitled, white, and during Apartheid.
You would be hard pressed to find someone LESS qualified then Alexandra Fuller to write a book about Native Americans.
Not just writing about them, but as if she is one. She wrote this book as if she has an inner understanding of Native Americans lives. As if she, or any white person reading this, could have one inkling of understanding of what it is like to be raised as an Native American.
You know who does have an understanding? Any of these profoundly amazing writers:
Louise Eldrich
Janet Campbell Hale
Leslie Marmon SIlko
Lorna Dee Cervantes
Allison Adelle Hedge Coke
Joy Harjo
Joan Naviyuk Kane
Deborah Miranda
Esther Belin
Adrian C. Louis (one of my favorite poets in the universe)
But you know who should NOT ever, ever, ever write a book about Native Americans?
A white woman born and raised in a colonized and oppressed country and where she was the utmost priveleged- due to her whiteness. A woman who is not Native American by any stretch of anyone's imagination. A white woman who feels so utterly privileged that she writes a book not only about Native Americans, but as if she is a Native American.
For future reference, when you need a blatant, ""no-shit- WTF just happened here?"" example of
WHITE ARROGANT PRIVILEGE, see Alexandra Fuller's ""Quiet Until the Thaw.""
This is such utter bullshit on a cosmic level that I can't imagine anyone on this green marble of an earth thinking this is a good idea. Did no one, absolutely no one at her publishing house say, ""umm, this is straight up cultural appropriation.""
You cannot do enough 'research', you cannot marry into, you cannot get a MA degree, you cannot live near a reservation and think that you have enough understanding to write other people's experience.
You just can't. And if you weren't steeped in the oceans of white privilege you were born into- you would know that.
**She did spend time on Pine Ridge and it would have been marvelous to read a book about her experience there. About how that dovetailed into her experience in Rhodesia, but this book, as well crafted and well written as it may be, is beyond the pale for me. Cultural appropriation at its finest.

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction, Lgbt, Cultural, Ireland",Shelby *trains flying monkeys*,"This book starts with a young girl being kicked out of her church because she is pregnant. The church and her family toss her out and she heads off to Dublin.
On reading the first bit of this story I thought everyone five starring this book had lost their minds...it wasn't bad but I was not turning pages very fast. (Partly due to being sucked into the Netflix void called Wentworth..not sorry)
Then the baby is born and we meet Cyril...and then I began to understand the rave reviews.
Cyril is given up for adoption by that young girl and is adopted by Charles and Maude. Charles and Maude Avery are a different kind of couple..and they make sure that everyone knows that Cyril is not a 'real Avery.' They don't mistreat Cyril so don't think it's the poor abused orphan story..they are just very different. (You are going to have to read this one because nothing can describe this book.)
Cyril starts to grow up and begins to realize that his feelings for his best friend Julian are not what the people around him would feel comfortable with. Including Julian himself. So Cyril must keep his true feelings hidden except for going to confession with a priest. (That goes so badly but I snorted coffee out my nose and across the room.)
This book is the story of a life. The ups and downs. The funny and the heartbreaking. It takes you through that life with Cyril and you live though the fear that homosexuality might be discovered where it was illegal. You live through the early AIDS epidemic..you live this life right alongside this character.
And it's a magical trip.
The only thing I'd have to say bad about this book is that I think the size of it may keep people from reading it. They are going to miss out because I loved every single page.

NECESITO QUE ALGUIEN TRADUZCA ESTE LIBRO AL ESPAÃ‘OL.
En mi opiniÃ³n, este es uno de los libros mÃ¡s subestimados de Jennifer Armentrout. Me encanta el mensaje que deja la historia, acerca de asumir las responsabilidades de nuestros actos, pero aceptar tambiÃ©n que somos humanos y cometemos errores. Sobre todo, tomar consciencia.
Por eso, decidÃ­ releerlo (y me demorÃ© algo asÃ­ como 24 horas). Por eso, y porque querÃ­a volver a leer a Lena y Sebastian â¤ï¸
~~~
Jennifer Armentrout es una de mis autoras favoritas. Me encanta prÃ¡cticamente todo lo que escribe, con algunas excepciones sueltas por ahÃ­. Y cada vez que agarro uno de sus libros, tengo la certeza de que lo voy a disfrutar, o que me va a hacer sufrir, pero al final me va a dejar igual con una sonrisa.
It There's no Tomorrow es un libro YA, muy similar a The Problem with Forever, pero mejor.
Lena es una chica normal en todo sentido. Tiene tres mejores amigas, con quienes va a todas partes. Y tiene a Sebastian, el chico que vive en la casa de al lado y que es su mejor amigo desde que ambos tenÃ­an 8 aÃ±os. Es una amistad muy fuerte, que creo que la autora logra transmitir en las primeras pÃ¡ginas del libro, de una forma impecable.
El problema estÃ¡ en que Lena siempre ha estado enamorada de Sebastian.
AsÃ­ que, el primer tercio es sobre cÃ³mo ella vive con su enamoramiento, convencida de que Ã©l sÃ³lo quiere ser su amigo. Las cosas se complican (view spoiler) y la amistad de Lena con Sebastian sufre.
Hasta una noche en que la tragedia golpea su vida de una forma dramÃ¡tica, que no estaba esperando.
Le siguen pÃ¡ginas y pÃ¡ginas de confusiÃ³n, angustia, discusiones, arrepentimiento, rabia y frustraciÃ³n. Y a pesar de que esto dura un poco mÃ¡s de un tercio del libro, creo que la autora lo logra hacer de una forma muy real, sin que resulte agotador para el lector. Ahora, tambiÃ©n es cierto que la actitud de algunos personajes me molestÃ³ en mÃ¡s de alguna ocasiÃ³n (view spoiler), pero creo que eso es justamente lo que le da realismo a la historia. No todas las personas reaccionamos de la mejor manera, y eso queda claramente plasmado en el libro.

Person : are you okay?

And as Yeva
scanned the walls, each one lined with shelves and each one full
of leather-bound books, at least a hundred books, more than she
knew existed in one place, she felt her heart might simply burst.
I truly don't know why I didn't really like this book. Maybe it's because I was in reading slump while reading it ? or maybe it was just the book that wasn't really interesting ? the reason is either of them.
Before I read this book, I kind of had high expectations about it because I heard so many great things about it and even though, retelling is not one of my favorite genres, I still like reading it.
I was so excited when I first started reading it, like really really excited. THE BLURB SOUNDED GOOD TO ME.
This was what I felt when I began reading it. I was excited and the beginning of the book was pretty good.
but then the more I read it, the more I realized that this book didn't meet my expectations. I thought this book would be action-packed, but it wasn't. there're several action scenes in this book but it's not enough and oh my God, there were a lot of information and too much talking and NOT ENOUGH ACTION SCENES. I READ THIS BOOK JUST BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ACTION-PACKED.
OH AND I CERTAINLY DON'T NEED THE DRAMA BETWEEN YEVA-SOLMIR-ASENKA. UGH.
I'm going to speak about them but I have to put spoiler tag on it, because I'm afraid someone would be spoiled.
SPOILER!

END OF THE SPOILER.
and now the romance between Yeva and the beast. I consider it as enemy-to-lover-kind of romance. Yeva hates the beast at the beginning but then she slowly ... understands the beast? well, basically she develops feelings toward the beast but the saddest thing is, I could not feel anything for them. Not even a spark. Their romance was just boring for me. I felt as if the romance was forced.
I don't know what else to talk about. I did enjoy reading it at the beginning but then after that the realization sank in that it didn't meet my expectations and then there was that whole drama that I hate. *sighs* I guess, the only thing that I loved in this book was the bond between the sisters. The bond was beautiful and sweet. I have a big sister and I love her so much and I certainly could relate to the bond between Yeva, Asenka and Lena.

The mystery was solved, the villain had been captured, and the plot had reached a satisfying resolution . . . and then there was another chunk of text leading up to a totally unnecessary cliffhanger. So now, again, readers have to wait a year or more to find out what happens next. If I like the author's voice and the characters in a series, I don't have to be tricked into buying the next book.

Finally when Sophie was five â€“ after giving Andrew more chances than Lindsey could remember â€“ she fled with Sophie in the dead of night. After a long period in hiding, and to her immense relief, Andrew was sent to jail.
Eleven years later Andrew was once again out on the streets â€“ free to harass; free to play his mind games with Lindsey all over again. She was frightened â€“ but more so for Sophie who was an impressionable teenager and had no memory of the terror her father had inflicted on her mother. Would Sophie contact her father? Or would he contact her? Lindsey begged her not to see or speak to him, but Sophie had a mind of her own â€“ she wanted to know her fatherâ€¦

Lindsey knew they couldnâ€™t continue running â€“ Sophieâ€™s final year in school was important and she also wanted her own life â€“ a life without constantly looking over her shoulder. Would it ever happen? Would they ever know peace and happiness?

IN OTHER LANDS is subversive, silly, sassy, strange, and sweet. It's also a wee bit heartbreaking. And sometimes you kinda wonder if anything is happening, and what's even going on, and maybe Elliot is like super abrasive and awful (kinda like how Hermione could've been if she was completely without filter and did not absorb her besties' social skills), but then you're charmed by the whole thing all over again, marvel at all the gender reversal and discussion over traditional roles turned on their heads, and get to experience a fantasy story where the lead character avoids all sorts of violent conflict, preferring to use words and treaties instead of fists and war.
""I don't need you to explain to me the concept of a magical land filled with fantastic creatures that only certain special children can enter. I am acquainted with the last several centuries of popular culture. There are books. And cartoons, for the illiterate.""

I admit that I am a big fan of Emma Scott as I always love her beautifully articulated words and how she has the ability to draw me in and feel absolutely every emotion. â€œThe Butterfly Projectâ€ is definitely my favourite Emma Scott book to date and it is also my favourite book of 2017 thus far.

Zelda Rossi has recently moved to New York from Vegas in the hopes of having her graphic novel published. After a less than successful meeting with a publisher, who informs Zelda that her novel needed more heart, she contemplates packing it in and moving back to Vegas. But before she has a chance to seriously consider this, she has a chance encounter with a bus boy at an Italian restaurant and her life is forever changed.
Beckett Copeland works two jobs in order to make a living; one as a bike messenger in NYC and the second as a bus boy at an Italian restaurant. Beckett doesnâ€™t have many choices when it comes to earning a living, due to a major life altering mistake he made a few years ago. Beckett is utterly riddled with guilt and he wonâ€™t allow himself to be happy as he feels he is the last person to deserve any. Beckett is such a kind, sweet and beautiful soul who will do anything from giving the last of his money to someone in need, to bringing food to a lonely elderly neighbour. He is struggling to make rent when Zelda makes him an offer he canâ€™t refuse.
Zelda comes to Beckett with an offer to become roommates, which will help them both. Beckett will be able to pay his rent and Zelda needs a place to live and work on her novel, now that she has decided to stay in New York. Both Zelda and Beckett are no strangers to tragedy, which has ultimately shaped both their lives and caused much pain, heartache and guilt. They soon develop a beautiful friendship where they comfort, support and help each other overcome their guilt.
The friendship soon morphs into something more and it was a beautiful journey to be a part of. Two tortured souls healing each other through the act of kindness and love.
â€œAs tight as he held me, and wherever we touched became proof to one another that we were not alone.â€
I cannot stress enough how sensational this story really was. Both Zelda and Beckett absolutely stole my heart from start to finish. This story is about love, loss, family and above all else forgiveness. This story really showcased the power of forgiveness and the immense courage it takes to learn to forgive yourself when you canâ€™t possibly see past the guilt you feel. One small or large action whether it be for good or bad, can forever change the course of your life. I could not recommend this story highly enough. (less)",Positif
,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction, Art",Sara,"I have long been fascinated with the artwork of Andrew Wyeth, and particularly his body of work centered around Christina Olson and her rustic home in Maine. I knew, therefore, that a well constructed book about those persons would be interesting to me. For once, I got more than I anticipated. This book is marvelous.
I must say, in fairness, that this is more about Christina herself and has less to do with Andrew Wyeth or his art than I had thought it would. No problem. Christina is a complex and multidimensional person with a life worth the exploration. Crippled at an early age, she is a study in self-reliance, strength, and perseverance. She is a study, as well, in the loneliness and isolation that comes with being different.
Itâ€™s a good question. How do I think of myself? The answer surprises us both. â€œI think of myself as a girl,â€ I say.
One of the themes at the heart of this novel is the difference between how we see others and how they see themselves. Christina encounters so many people who see her as her infirmities, who discount her feeling and her intelligence because she has a broken body. Her brother sees her as his sister, who manages to take care of a home and family despite her limitations and as his playmate and sibling who has shared his life. She sees herself as a whole person, encased in a chrysalis from which there is no escape.
It is this that explains the relationship that forms between the artist and his subject:
Andy doesnâ€™t usually bring anything, or offer to help. He doesnâ€™t register alarm at the way we live. He doesnâ€™t see us as a project that needs fixing. He doesnâ€™t perch on a chair, or linger in a doorway, with the air of someone who wants to leave, whoâ€™s already halfway out the door. He just settles in and observes.
As we watch Christinaâ€™s life unfold, we see how much of it is dictated by how others see her. We watch her dream and we watch those dreams destroyed, we see windows of opportunity open and close with slams that echo like the screen doors of the old house. We watch her world collapse upon her, and yet we see her struggle to make the most of the life she is given. At the end, these words of Klineâ€™s sum it up completely, The older I get, the more I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance.
This novel is everything that I look for in a great novel. There are characters that are real and lives that have meaning. There is tension for these characters to transcend and obstacles to power through, and the glory of the human spirit to applaud and descry.
That this is based upon the life of an actual historic person makes it all the more poignant. I will now view Wyethâ€™s Christinaâ€™s World with a new layer of meaning. For as our character, Christina, says, Here is what I know: Sometimes the least believable stories are the true ones.

---------------------------
I rarely read Contemporary Christian Romance Fiction, so I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. The characters were well drawn and interesting; I really appreciated how Mia and Jake weren't defined by their romantic attraction to each other, but instead by their goals in life - and, to some extent, their faith in God. (Not to mention that their tragic pasts drove them and the plot in more ways than one.)
That being said, I didn't wholeheartedly root for Mia and Jake's relationship. In some ways, it seemed like Jake and Mia were attracted to each on a wholly physical level than their compatibility as a couple. I didn't appreciate how physical their relationship was, with lots of kissing before Mia was even sure she wanted to be with Jake. It was hard to root for them because of that. However, I did root for Jake when it came to Camp Connie and Mia when it came to Mission Medical. <3
Sam and Lucy were two of my favorite characters. While they did make a mistake by sleeping together before they got married, I like that they did get married and that their marriage was portrayed in an awesome, realistic way. I really liked that. I also liked how the author sensitively portrayed Alzheimer's disease, something I wasn't familiar with before I read The Two of Us.
The last few chapters were amazing. I loved how everything wrapped up. (Though the epilogue didn't work for me as much I would have liked - it felt sort of patched on. But that's the only complaint I have about the ending.) I even teared up a little...happy tears, so don't worry. :)
Overall, I believe that any fan of Contemporary Christian Romance Fiction would thoroughly enjoy this book. A sweet, warm, comforting read.

,"Romance, New Adult, Contemporary Romance, Contemporary, Music",â™¥ Jx PinkLady Reviews â™¥,"STAY marks my first AL Jackson reading experience and the fifth story in the Bleeding Stars series written in such a manner that it can be totally enjoyed as a STANDALONE romance. Equally the many fans of this series will appreciate revisiting a cast of characters they have previously met and loved.
The story centres on tattooed rock star Ash and Willow, the girl who literally saves him in the opening chapters ensuring STAY gained my immediate engagement with the characters. I warmed to them and wanted to know how their lives would become entwined after this dramatic start and how they would ultimately fall in love.
I liked the characters and thought I would easily fall in love with this angst ridden romantic story but ultimately and against popular opinion I didnâ€™t love this book as much as I had hoped. I found there was too many word/phrase repeats, the prose was overtly flowery, even the heroâ€™s dialogue which didnâ€™t fit how I believed a tattooed rock star would talk and the angst, an element I crave in my reading material, felt somewhat contrived rather than organically formed. These three elements reflect my personal reading tastes and I know many, many readers will disagree with me but unfortunately these elements caused my disengagement hence my 'like' rating rather than love. The last 20% and the culmination of the story, although involving a high level of coincidence and tragedy, was incredibly interesting and a satisfying aspect of the read and I totally see why many of my reading friends love so much.

A prequel to The Girl With All the Gifts this does a great job of reintroducing us to a complex dystopian world where the monsters may not be as â€˜monstrousâ€™ as first thought.
The pacing for this is just as good as the previous novel, and builds to a satisfying conclusion. The author does a good job at concluding some loose plot threads from the previous novel while still managing to weave a suspenseful story. From a world that is well established in â€˜The Girl With All The Giftsâ€™ I think it was a smart move to do a prequel rather than rehash a story that was so well concluded as it allowed for a greater degree of freedom for the author to introduce new concepts and characters without interfering with the original story.
The new characters are just as morally ambiguous as in the previous instalment. Although not a new concept in horror/dystopian fiction (I Am Legend is clearly an inspirational jumping board here) I like this idea that creatures plaguing the earth may not necessarily be the bad guys. They understand the concept of love and family, and this complex relationship between human and monster is intriguing and rich in thought provoking storytelling. However, I did find a lot of the â€˜humanâ€™ characters rather similar and indistinguishable, and sometimes I craved the company of Melanie from TGWATG. Her innocence and purity really stood out for me in a world whereâ€™s sheâ€™s considered abhorrent, and that sort of angle is really lacking here as few (if any) of the characters can be considered sympathetic, and I wasnâ€™t really drawn to any of them.
I did enjoy this, and would certainly recommend it to fans of dystopian horror who enjoy complex characters thatâ€™s a little different to your standard horror cast. (less)",Positif

The flashbacks to her romance plotline were saccharine and dull. The present day plot was plodding and contrived, and I'm sure many readers will guess the plot twists before the oblivious characters.

A few reviews that mention some of my grievances here, here and here.
After 15 books, plus ten thousand spin-offs it comes as a surprise to me that I think this is where I'm gonna quit it. But enduring verbal and almost physical abuse from the co-parent of your children is where I draw the line with how much I can stand of Ward's blatant mistreatment of women. And I say that while being a huge fan of Qhuinn's character (before this book) and actually not liking Layla.
Not to mention the absolute obliteration of the rules of a paranormal world that have been shoved down our throats for FIFTEEN books. It's been a weary and tiring and not at all good journey. I hope this series ends (ha! the joke's on me) with everyone and their mother getting killed. They all deserve it.
Final note: I can't believe that this is the last I'll ever read about one of my favourite couples of the series:

I loved the set up for this book â€“ a woman thinks sheâ€™s pregnant from a one night stand so she goes to get checked out only to discover that the guy she hooked up with is her ob/gyn. Awkward!
Bren is a conservationist who works at the zoo and who is happily and contentedly consumed by her career. After watching her mother fall apart after the death of her father, she wants no part of love, and avidly avoids anything remotely resembling a relationship, instead focussing all of her attention on her job.
What I did technically couldnâ€™t be called dating. Unless, of course, he counted my long-term, committed relationship with my friendly bedside vibrator. If that were the case, Iâ€™d bet at this point I could petition for common law marriage.
Mason Bentley is at the other end of the scale. Of course he loves his job and is dedicated to his career, but he wants love. He wants a relationship, and he wants the happy family life that he himself had.
Itâ€™s going to sound cheesy, but the fact is, I want a soul mate. Someone who not only loves me, but understands me on my deepest level.
Bren and Mason met in a bar and had the hottest sex of their lives before Bren ran out on Mason in the morning. He knew that she was the one for him and searched for her without any luck, she had no intention of ever seeing him againâ€¦. and we all know how that one works out.
Like I said, this book has a really cute set up, and with Mason determined to not only get to know his possible baby-mama, but to make her his, the stage is set for fireworks with him pushing for time together and an emotional connection and Bren trying to keep her distance. I loved that we have a hero who a genuinely nice guy, and he is the one pushing for something meaningful. Heâ€™s got a battle on his hands for sure, but thereâ€™s a nice mix of sweet, fun and sexy as Mason works to make his case.
â€œAll you need to do is say yes, Bren. Say yes to taking a chance with me.â€
Having said that though, the love story moves really fast and as a result I really didnâ€™t get into it as much as I was hoping. Masonâ€™s insistence that Bren was his one and only based on one night of steaming hot sex was really farfetched, and the â€˜relationshipâ€™ didnâ€™t feel real (even for a romance book). And I never warmed up to Bren â€“ I feel like she needed a slap through most of the book so she could wake up and just get over herself!
I like that the story wasnâ€™t predictable, but the â€˜dramaâ€™ was eye rolling, and while the epilogue was cute, again it was completely unrealistic (having been in a similar situation myself).
So, yeah. Not what I was hoping for, but there were some cute moments and it was a quick read.

FOUR HEARTS--
""-I'm not a woman, but that doesn't make me a man either.""
""Right. What?""
""You heard.""
K.J. Charles returns with the last addition to the Sins of the Cities, book #3 An Suitable Heir. And I have been waiting on this book since reading about 31 year old private enquiry agent Mark Braglewicz in the first book. He's the plain speaking detective that will seek the truth no matter if it hurts.
You must read this series in order and don't skip to get to the one armed detective to get why Mark is so great. He's on the hunt for the lost heir and what he finds is not what he expects.
The Flying Starlings, 23 year old twins Pen and Greta have been right under everyone's noses in London, working as trapeze artists. When I learned who Mark's lover would be I wondered how it could ever work, an acrobat aristocrat in Victorian Britain? No way! And then make the long lost heir gender fluid? Say what?
Thankfully, the premise was handled in Charles' more than capable hand. and the story despite the gloomy setting was light. With the mystery of ""Fogman"" looming, a noble family's dirty secrets just dripping out of various sources, I thought Pen being non binary in Victorian times when it wouldn't have a word to exist at the time was going to be a lot.
Not so. It was relatively easy once Pen had found a person to listen and understand. There were minor struggles but nothing that brought the plot to a halt.
""Bit of a leap in the dark, though?"" Mark suggested, in a last gasp of decency.
Pen smiled, gloriously, a full, wide smile that lit his face and gave him a startling resemblance to Clem. ""Mark. Leaping in the dark is what I do.""
The romance was uncomplicated. Pen and Mark are round pegs in society's square hole and they don't need to fit it, nor should anyone. Being as most of the conflict was internal for Pen: how Pen's perceived, how others expect Pen to fit society's gender norms and Pen's trauma from a lifetime of battling the expectations, other than the murder lurking about, nothing much happens.
It's a case of boy meets Pen. Boy doesn't care which way a person is as long as they're happy. Pen likes that someone gets the way Pen's world is. And they fall for each other super quick. It's borderline insta-love and light and sweet really. The 'I love you's' come pretty quick with the amount of time the main characters spend together on page. Granted, some parts were time jumped.
The strongest character of the book: Lazarus.
Mark is rock solid as always. And consistent which is a perfect foil for Pen.
But Justin Lazarus, the shining smarmy star from Book #2, returns to assist when needed. And I hands down adore the snake! Some might say he's a hustler, liar and cheat.
And they're correct.
But I also say he's deviously clever.
He stole the show for me, even though his page time is limited. I might be seeing this through green colored greasy glasses. But dude is awesome. I would seriously read a book of his misadventures. He goes into K.J. Charles fave characters list for sure.
A close second for this book? Greta. What a great sister to have.
The mystery is wrapped up quite neatly. And there is a solid HEA despite the time period. All of the couples introduced found a great match. This book isn't my most favorite of the series. It didn't turn out to be what I hoped for. I wanted more page time between Mark and Pen, more intimate moments. Mark's super practical and plain speaking, I don't think it would have added more to the plot. I think it's part greed, part being ensnared by the Mark from books #1-2. Any angsting he did was told tot he reader instead of being read about.
I love the way Pen was written and respect that was given. Both main characters are strong and though the story is told through dual POV, it's really Pen's book.
As it should be. Pen's glorious. ;D
I definitely recommend this series.

,"Mystery, Thriller, Crime, Fiction, Audiobook, Suspense, Detective",Kathleen (QueenKatieMae),"Author Craig Johnson said that for years his fans have been asking him to write a novel about a young Walt, a young Henry, a younger Lucian. The Western Star is that novel and fans get to see Walt's rough start as a deputy just returned from Vietnam; and we get to meet Martha, his since passed wife. But, word of warning, it's a darker novel than his usual, and it's a cliffhanger.
The story skips between the year 1972 and present day and while, for me, there were a couple of moments of confusion, the narrative is smooth and well done. Young Walt, deputized only two weeks, is boarding a train with his new boss, Sheriff Lucian Connelly. It's a yearly event for the Wyoming Sheriffs' Association and is a guaranteed rowdy, alcohol-soaked excursion. Before boarding, Walt watches his wife Martha walk away, her wedding ring in his hand. They're young, she's pregnant, and she thinks he can do much more with his life than law enforcement.
Skip ahead to present day and Walt, Henry, Lucian and Vic are in Cheyenne to see Cady and the baby. More than that, Walt is there for a parole hearing for the most dangerous man he's ever come across in his career. That man is dying and his lawyer is asking for a compassionate commutation of his life sentence, something Walt will never allow, nor accept.
Meanwhile back in 1972, a sheriff from the train is found dead on the tracks and another is missing. It doesn't take the reader long to figure out that whoever is the murderer is also the inmate present-day Walt does not want let free. The inmate is never referred to by name and he was sentenced in 1972. And as the story progresses the reader learns why this man should stay in prison until the moment he draws his last breath.
What is really interesting about The Western Star is seeing the mindset of post-Vietnam America with a young Walt Longmire in the middle. He's called a ""baby killer"" by fellow law enforcement. Women are regarded as property. Walt hitches a ride on a hippie bus and is clueless as to who he's riding with (no spoilers but I found it to be a little too precious). I loved meeting Martha; like their daughter, she's smart and she's not a pushover.
The mystery is solved at the end and the reader does learn the identity of the killer and, boy, was I surprised. But, it's also at this time, present-day events intersect with the past and that's where the cliffhanger comes in play. I know there are grumbles that writing a cliffhanger is just a ploy to sell more books but Craig Johnson pointed out this is his longest storyline to date, and it is an ongoing storyline, so it was either write it as one big book or divide the mysteries. Either way, I know I am going to read his next book. The Western Star has set the stage for what guarantees to be an even darker, more vengeful story.
Well written, as always, and absolutely loved that young Walt was carrying a copy of Agatha Christie's Murder On The Orient Express while onboard the fated Western Star. As one character so aptly summed up Christie's mysteries: ""He did it, she did it, nobody did it or they all did it."" Words of wisdom. (less)",Positif
,"Young Adult, Contemporary, Romance, Fiction ",Amy Layton,"This book made me way more emotional than I thought it would. Eight Days takes place over the span of eight days, and it does not make you wait for the emotions to hit. And they hit hard. Matty's life just got significantly tougher (though he wouldn't care to admit it) after his father just up and left with his uncle's wife. His mother is having a hard time coping, but Matty is on summer vacation, so he has lots of time to think. Until he meets Priya, an alien from a far off planet. Now, his father was hardcore into alien conspiracies, which Matty thought was fun until it took over his life and prevented him from getting work. And now that there's a real life alien in front of him...well, unlike Fox Mulder, he isn't sure if he wants to believe.
While she's waiting for her kind to reclaim her, she's busy gathering data--which leads into great hilarity. And Matty finds it kindof cute, too.
At first, I must admit I was afraid of this falling into the ""Born Sexy Yesterday"" trope, but as Priya's story begins to unravel, so does the trope, though not in entirely uncomplicated ways. And Matty recognizes this, too, in what I think is one of the most beautiful closing chapters I've read in a good long while.
Overall, this story is a great read that you will power through. It's moving, it's emotional, and it's powerful. It gave me a lot to think about on the topic of family, relationships, and endings without closure. This is definitely worth the read.

,"Nonfiction, Self Help, Personal Development, Business, Leadership",Deanna,"Make Your Bed is an incredible gem packaged tightly into a small book that lends itself well to an easy and quick read. This book offers tidbits that are simplistic yet powerful. Each chapter highlights a little thing that can make great change in oneâ€™s life which then can change the world.
The statement â€œchange the worldâ€ may seem pompous and easily blown off as unrealistic, but really, each of us do indeed make decisions on a daily basis that can affect others. The question is do we want to make change within ourselves which then has the potential to impact others?
This may sound like a boring book, but itâ€™s far from boring. Admiral William H. McRaven wrote each chapter with a tone of humility, as evident of how he concisely told personal stories and stories of others to show how the little things in life have the potential to make a huge impact on your life. These stories are real and down to earth. None of them highlight a â€œsuper heroâ€ moment but rather the daily and seemingly unimportant.
Make Your Bed is packed with small, very real, doable, and applicable life gems regardless of a personâ€™s station in life. I am confident that every person who reads this book will walk away inspired by at least one little thing to make a change in their life and then maybe, quite maybe, the world.

,"Fiction, Thriller, Mystery, Short Stories, Crime",Scott,"This book is primarily targeted for fans of the â€œJack Reacherâ€ series by Lee Child, and will probably most enjoyed by the more hardcore fans. It is a collection of twelve short stories involving Reacher, and about five of them have already been available in electronic format. It seems to be the practice of several mainstream authors to write short stories for e-readers and then when they have enough to put together, they publish the stories in print editions. One of the benefits is having the stories organized together for easy access, and enabling authors to sell a product twice â€“ individually and in a collection. (Yes, I realize that is an editorial opinion and I will stop now.
Some stories are better than others. I really enjoyed â€œToo Much Timeâ€ and â€œSmall Warsâ€. I was not a big fan of â€œNot a Drillâ€. However, one of the nice things about the stories is that you get to experience Reacher as a teenager, young adult, and when he was in the military. You get to interact with his family in some of them, including his brother Joe, his dad and mom. One of the things I appreciated was that Lee Child really wasted few words. The stories ranged from about 55 pages to as few as about 5 pages. Each story was only as long as it needed to be, which was nice. If they were short and to the point, then that was how Lee wrote it.
Overall, the more hardcore Reacher fans will find the most enjoyment from these different types of shorter adventures. Others will appreciate some of the stories more than others. I am not usually a big fan of short story collections, but this one was worth the read. Not great, but good.

,"Fiction, Literary Fiction",Donna Davis,"The place is Amicus, Kansas; the Campbell family has come together to celebrate the birthday of their frail, ancient patriarch, Abel. Ultimately, though, their attention is drawn, unavoidably, to the youngest among them. Billy is a walking pharmacy, but he wonâ€™t be walking anywhere for much longer if something isnâ€™t done.
I read this book free and early thanks to Net Galley and St. Martinâ€™s Press. If I had paid full retail price, it would have been worth every red cent. It had me at hello, and performed a miracle of sorts by rendering me temporarily speechless; I had to gather my thoughts and look at my notes before I could comment.
But back to the Campbells of Kansas. Everyone has known for some time about Billyâ€™s dependency issues; heâ€™s been riding the roller coaster of addiction for many years. Billyâ€™s father wants to take a hard line with him, while his mother, Hattie, just wants to bring him home and tuck him into the guest bedroom. Brother Jesse objects, â€œHeâ€™s forty-fricking-seven, Mom.â€
Elder daughter Doro, who is sixty and perhaps the only sane, normal person in the family, is concerned for her mother, who is past eighty and has already had a heart attack. Doro reminds her mother that the family has had its problems before and will have them again; at some point, Hattie has to let go. Either let the siblings help Billy, or let Billy help himself. Hattie cannot do it forever.
The setting of Amicus and the time period we see as we reach back into the familyâ€™s history is well rendered, but remains discreetly in the background as it should, not hijacking the story. The story itself is based on character, not just of any one person, but of the family itself. By the twenty percent mark I feel as if I have known these people all my life. The full range of emotion is in play as I immerse myself in this intimate novel, and there are many places that make me laugh out loud.
It isnâ€™t too long before I can identify someone I know that is a Hattie, and someone that is a Billy. Given the widespread horror of opiate addiction, I will bet you a dollar that you know someone too.
But before the halfway mark is reached, a terrible sense of dread comes over me, an aha moment I would not wish on my worst enemy. I begin to sense that perhaps I am Hattie. And within a week of having read this epic story, my eldest child calls and tells me that heâ€™s had a phone call from his younger siblingâ€™s dealer, a man that flatly states, â€œI donâ€™t want your brother on my conscience, man. I wonâ€™t sell to him anymore, but Iâ€™m telling you, there are plenty of others that do. You gotta do something, cause heâ€™s out of control.â€
Generally, I do not include personal notes in my reviews, because thatâ€™s not generally what the reader is looking for. But here I have chosen to do so because this problem is everywhere. In the case of Billy Campbell, thereâ€™s a complicating factor: Billy is HIV positive and has been since he was 21. And again, I suspect that for many others, such issues also blur the distinction between medical treatment of some sort, and addiction.
I hope that you can get this book and enjoy it for its sly humor, brilliant word-smithery, and unmatchable character development. Itâ€™s excellent fiction, just exactly right for a chilly autumn evening in your favorite chair or snuggled beneath the quilts. But for me, it is valuable as a wake-up call, and it will do the same for many other readers alsoâ€”I have no doubt.
Itâ€™s the right story, at the right time. (less)",Positif

He is a African-American male, high school senior that is at the top of his class. The book starts off with a police officer putting him in handcuffs because he was helping his ex-girlfriend late at night (she looks white), because she is drunk.

Carve the Mark by Veronica Roth
Book One of the Carve the Mark series
Publisher: Katherine Tegen Books
Publication Date: January 17, 2017
Rating: 3 stars
Source: ARC sent by the publisher
Summary (from Goodreads):
On a planet where violence and vengeance rule, in a galaxy where some are favored by fate, everyone develops a currentgift, a unique power meant to shape the future. While most benefit from their currentgifts, Akos and Cyra do notâ€”their gifts make them vulnerable to othersâ€™ control. Can they reclaim their gifts, their fates, and their lives, and reset the balance of power in this world?
Cyra is the sister of the brutal tyrant who rules the Shotet people. Cyraâ€™s currentgift gives her pain and powerâ€”something her brother exploits, using her to torture his enemies. But Cyra is much more than just a blade in her brotherâ€™s hand: she is resilient, quick on her feet, and smarter than he knows.
Akos is from the peace-loving nation of Thuvhe, and his loyalty to his family is limitless. Though protected by his unusual currentgift, once Akos and his brother are captured by enemy Shotet soldiers, Akos is desperate to get his brother out aliveâ€”no matter what the cost. When Akos is thrust into Cyraâ€™s world, the enmity between their countries and families seems insurmountable. They must decide to help each other to surviveâ€”or to destroy one another.
What I Liked:
Carve the Mark is absolutely worth the hype and the excitement, and it's definitely worth your time to read this book if you've been looking forward to reading it. Chances are, it won't disappoint you. In many ways, I liked this book a lot. But there were several specific things that might seem small or insignificant in the grand schemes of things, that ended up really bothering me. Hence, the three-star rating.
This story is told by two characters - Akos, a Thuvhe, and Cyra, a Shotet. The Thuvhe are a peace-loving people living on Urek. The Shotet are more aggressive nomadic people that conquer various nations and planets. When he is fourteen, Akos is captured, along with his brother, by the Shotet, who kill his father in front of him. They are taken to the Shotet stronghold of Urek, ruled by Ryzek Noavek, a ruthless tyrant and older brother of Cyra. They are stolen for their currentgifts - Akos's brother Eijeh is the next oracle of the Thuvhe. Akos grows into his currentgift - he can interrupt the current (he can cancel it out, turn it off, that sort of thing). Several years later, Akos is shaped into a warrior, but he has lost known of his humanity. He is not a killer, though he has killed to protect himself. He is brought to help Cyra Noavek, whose currentgift is inflicting pain on others with her touch. No one can touch her without feeling pain, but Akos can, because he interrupts the current (and all currentgifts are ""fueled"" by the current). Akos cooperates because he wants to rescue his brother and flee. But the more he and Cyra interact, the more they learn about each other, and the more they realize that they share common interests, interests that could incite wars.
The beginning of the book was incredibly confusing (I'll talk about that in the next section), but once I (sort of) got a grasp of the world and everything going on, I started to get into the story and really sink into it. This is science fiction, though certain elements (like the currentgifts) can definitely be categorized as fantasy. This story takes place across planets of a galaxy, so it's a space-y type of science fiction.
I must say, Roth did an excellent job with the characterization and character growth, specifically in terms of Cyra and Akos. I'll start with Akos. He is easily my favorite character of the book. He is Thuvhe, and so he is brought up to be more peaceful and somewhat passive towards violence. Even several years being trained as a Shotet soldier doesn't break him down. He is compassionate, and he is strong. I liked him a lot, especially for his unbreakable will. I was amazing and in awe of how much pain and grief and despair he bore, for years. Akos grows into a character that still hates killing, and is sick over having to kill anyone, but can do it. He becomes so strong and capable in other ways, and he's also extremely intelligent and clever. He isn't an alpha type of YA hero - he's quietly intelligent and very, very human.
Cyra is almost the opposite of him, yet it slowly becomes apparent that she has similarities to him. She appears to be a brutal, cold, emotionless killer summoned and used by her brother, Ryzek. But Cyra does not enjoy wielding her painful power over others, and she definitely does not enjoy bending to Ryzek's will. In many ways, it is Akos who shows her mercy, what mercy is, and that she is still capable of being merciful, and better, and more. Cyra learns to turn her pain into something else. She loses none of her deadliness and her danger, but as the story goes on, she becomes stronger and more able to stand up to Ryzek.
Once I got past the first one hundred pages or so, I had little difficulty getting through the story. I was pretty engrossed and despite the book being rather long, I read it quickly. There is so much happening in this story, and I wanted to see how it would all end. There were so many moments when things could go disastrously wrong, and I held my breath as I turned the pages. No one can say that certain parts of this book weren't engrossing. A lot of the story ends up being about how to unseat Ryzek, and how to stay alive and protect each other.
There is romance! I liked seeing Akos and Cyra fall for each other. It's actually Cyra who shows her feelings first, which you wouldn't expect. Cyra is supposedly the more ruthless one, and Akos is the more emotional and merciful one. But it's Cyra that starts to fall for Akos first, and shows her hand first. I liked their dynamic a lot - they learn to trust each other before anything else. No love triangle! Thank goodness for that. I thought this romance was well-developed, and swoony towards the end.
There is also another romance which I thought was sweet. I can't say much about it because it'll spoil things, but it's between two characters that are good together.
The ending, as insane and chaotic as it is, is not a cruel ending. There is no horrible cliffhanger, which is surprising, since this is book one of a duology. You'd expect something really terrible to have happened at the end, hurting the main character(s). Don't get me wrong, terrible (permanent) things definitely happened; but the ending isn't a cliffhanger, and I definitely appreciate that.
Now I'm going to talk about the things I didn't really enjoy.
What I Did Not Like:
First: the initial one hundred pages or so? Very confusing, and very boring too. I had a hard time getting through the beginning of the story. There is so much information dumped into the first couple of chapters, and so many names. It also took me a while to realize that the beginning is when Akos is fourteen - and NOT the ""present"" time of the story. Same with Cyra's beginning - she is six when her chapter begins. The beginning has too much going on, and it isn't well-explained at first. I had to reread several of the chapters a few times to really get some sort of grasp as to what was happening.
I'm not sure I really understand the world/world-building? Currentgifts and their origin and how/why they exist still kind of elude me. What is the ""current""? Where did it come from? How is it magically given people these currentgifts? The currentgifts are things like inflicting pain upon touch, or not feeling pain at all, or seeing the future, or seeing every memory of a person.
Second: there are so many awful, brutal scenes in this book. I'm talking about torture and cruel treatment of people. I understand that this type of brutality is very real and exists in real life and has a place in this fictional world, but the brutality of a lot of it... didn't sit well with me. Usually a certain level of violence doesn't bother me too much? The violence in this book, while not exactly graphic, is horrifying. Which is probably the intent, but my stomach hurt, reading it.
Third: Not the biggest thing I didn't like, but I wasn't a huge fan of having Akos's POV in third-person, and then Cyra's in first-person. I loved reading from both of their POVs! But it would have been nice to have a little uniformity (either both in first, or both in third). Also it already scares me, that Roth chooses to tell this story from both Akos and Cyra's POVs. We saw what happened in Allegiant...
Fourth: problematic racial content. Oh yeah, I definitely see where people are coming from, when they say that this book has some racist content. The Shotet are portrayed as ""brown skinned"", aggressive, nomadic people. They stole Thuvhe children years ago, and the Thuvhe retaliated and stole Shotet children, but the way the story is told, the Shotet are the ""villains"". I mean, given that the first chapter is about Akos's father getting brutally murdered in front of him, I get why that would be implication. But there are definitely underlying tones of something problematic here: the Thuvhe, light-skinned peaceful people, and the Shotet, darker-skinned aggressive people, are both cliches. And what's more, it seems like most of the Shotet have very violent currentgifts, whereas the Thuvhe have more passive, non-violent gifts (like Akos's, or his mother's, or his brother's).
Do you see the problem here? Why is it that the ""aggressive"" people are always the brown/darker-skinned ones, and the more ""peaceful"" non-violent people are lighter-skinned? I have no qualms with the characters themselves (I adore Akos, and Cyra is such a fighter), but the social construct here is reflective of cliches and stereotypes.
Read THIS peace if you want more information. I definitely do not know it all, but I recognize and understand the issue at hand here, in terms of race and culture.
Would I Recommend It:
Yes, I had issues with this book, and I firmly believe that last issue needs to be addressed. And yes, I also enjoyed the book, for the most part, regardless. It's a good story, and I was definitely swept up in the story as I was reading. I'll be reading the sequel next year. I don't know if I really should recommend this book, given the evident issues. But I did like the story too. If you've been excited to read this book, believe me, it probably won't disappoint. But... recognize issues when you see them. Talk about them. Discuss and learn.
Rating:
3 stars. Like I said, this is a good story, and of all of Roth's books, it's probably her best. I think I liked it more than I liked her other books (definitely more than I liked Insurgent and Allegiant - though I never fully read Allegiant). I want to see where the story goes. But there were some things that held me back a little, in terms of my rating. (less)",Netral

Midnight at the Bright Ideas Club is this summer new star of the bookish mystery genre. For a novel that was first published only two months ago it got a lot of fans on Goodreads. Although I was reluctant at first to follow the buzz, I am glad I did because it was a fun read perfect for my summer vacation.
The main reason why this novel is so popular is that it seems to be written specially to tingle every book loverâ€™s pleasure receptors. First of all, the main character is a bookseller with a librarian father. Then, the title is the bookstore which is the location of few important plot developments. Moreover, Lydia, the MC possesses the traits that many book lovers can identify with. Add to this a mystery that revolves around messages hidden in books and you canâ€™t go wrong with the intended audience. It worked, I found myself smiling many times, thinking- This is me and I was immediately invested in the characterâ€™s quest to find the reason for her friendâ€™s suicide. However, I sometimes thought that the author was trying too much to satisfy my bookish personality.
The main mystery interlocked nicely with Lydiaâ€™s past secrets and I was surprised by some of the plot turns. Unfortunately, I guessed the main culprit quite early so a part of the fun was ruined for me when I realized I was right. Also, I thought that there were too many coincidences that made the plot feel forced.
The writing was ok, nothing special. The focus is on the setting and the plot so there is no space for too much deepness.
As I said, I enjoyed the novel, it is a perfect summer read but I probably wonâ€™t remember much about it in a few months.

I was so excited to pick up Ruth Ware's The Lying Game , as The Woman in Cabin 10 was one of my favorite reads of this year. Let me tell you right now, if you're expecting The Lying Game to be another iteration of the same story, you will be un/pleasantly surprised. I say it that way because, this story is told in a very different tone and manner than Ware's last two works so you might be caught off guard. The Lying Game starts off with Isa Wilde and her family, where she receives a text from her friend Kate - ""I need you."" - Immediately, Isa packs up and heads back to Salten, a boarding school set by the English Channel, where Kate resides by. June meets up with Kate and her other high school best friends Fatima and Thea to uncover mysteries surrounding their time at Salten, and reveal the truths about the effects of their dangerous game that they played; the lying game. As the story unfolds, the reader learns a lot about each character without it going too deep into non-relevant characterizations. The best part about this book is the feeling of girl power that I got while reading. I think it'll serve a nice purpose in that aspect.
The Lying Game is more of a teen drama than a thriller or mystery to me and it was too much of a slow burn for me to actually enjoy that much. It's not to say that you won't enjoy it, because I can tend to be stuck in my own mindset of what I enjoy with books. Ruth Ware's writing is one of the many reasons why she can slap me in the face, and I'd keep coming back for more. I will be back for the next Ruth Ware novel!

,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Retellings, Romance, Fairy Tales",Navessa,"This is a solid YA Beauty and the Beast retelling, full of girl power and feminist themes. Some of the story threads are definitely true to the original fairy tale (kidnapping, a curse, a ruined castle, a beast), but where Spooner deviates from that tale is where the meat of this story really comes from.
In this retelling, Beauty is something of a badass. A hunter who can move through a forest as though she is part of it.
This book starts off with her father as a wealthy merchant, who sacrificed his love of the woods to give his wife and three children a better life in town. A bad investment ends in tragedy for his business, and the family is forced to retreat back to his dilapidated country cottage. There, he re-enters the surrounding forest, stalking deeper and deeper into the wilderness in search of something that will re-instate his fortune and return the family to the good life they had in town.
This does not go so well for him. As you can imagine.
After he disappears, Beauty goes in search of him. She finds him eventually, and by then itâ€™s too late to realize that while sheâ€™s been stalking his tracks, that something else her father was looking for has been stalking her.
The concept of the Beast in this was really quite an original take, based more on Russian fairy tales than anything else. The magic, the enchanted forest, the creatures that lived within it, they were all just so original and refreshing.
I canâ€™t recommend this high enough for fans of fairy tale retellings.

,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Horror, Fiction",Trish,"I am so in love with this book (series)! Honestly, it's not every day that an author brings true magic into our world, but Seanan McGuire does just that with the Wayward Children.
This second story is a prequel to the first, telling of the events leading to Jack and Jill finding their door, what happens in their world, and how they were thrown out in the end.
First we follow the twins' parents as they come to wanting children in the first place, followed by the pregnancy, birth, the girls' first 5 years and then the rest until they find their door when aged 12.
The truly shining part was the description of their world however. As bleak and as looming and dangerous as it was, it was fantastic! We follow Jill through 5 years of living in the castle with the Master while her sister Jack works as the Doctor's apprentice. We learn of their world's rules and inhabitants but mostly about the girls themselves.
Because I've seen some people recommend this second book to other people to read first, a warning: don't do that or there will be major spoilers for the first volume. I mean, the mystery in the first was fairly obvious, but beginning with this one would make it too obvious.
There are way too many wonderful lines in this book for me to quote here so I will just add the quotes separately. Suffice it to say that every person was real and alive - some were infuriating, some got my pity and some I sympathized with. Knowing (roughly) what would happen did not slow or marr the story for a second; the events still unfolded as beautifully and tragically as imaginable. The prose was elegant without being pretentious (just like in the first book) and the wisdom packed into such a short book was staggering without being overwhelming.
Again, we had big social themes such as lesbianism, child care, emotional abuse, and victim-blaming bound up lightly in a pretty ribbon.
I mean Jack and Jill's father is the prime example of what is wrong with so many people: when the doctor tells him and his wife not to share the news of the pregnancy just yet (something almost every doctor says within the first 3 months), he says (though to himself) that his wife is not an idiot but ""good at being pregnant"" so of course she wouldn't lose the baby. Not to mention the fact that they don't want to share the news because they are so happy, but because the plan worked as it was scheduled and they want to be elevated into certain social circles which only a pregnancy/children can accomplish. *bangs head against the wall*
But we also had more ""quiet"" themes such as finding your true self, trying to stay true to yourself and finding a place where you belong.
Because after the children are born, they are forced into gender roles (think girly-pink vs. baby-blue) and the only good influence in their life is not only taken from them but HOW the parents do it is simply despicable. Honestly, some people shouldn't be allowed to have kids!
Thus, many of the things happening to the girls are the direct consequence of what Jack and Jill's parents did to them in their early years. The unfairness, of course, is that the parents won't suffer the consequences, the girls do. It's part of what makes this tale so truly tragic.
Interesting was also the fact that (view spoiler) Just like I very much liked the scene when the author (view spoiler) because it is true of course.
As of this afternoon, I have both volumes of this series in hardcover form but in case of this 2nd volume I listened to the audio version that was narrated beautifully by the author (she has a wonderful voice). I can recommend both, but had to have the printed version as I always do with profound tales that speak to me so clearly. And this is definitely one of my all-time favourites. (less)",Positif
,"Holiday, Christmas, Historical, Historical Fiction, Mystery, Christian Fiction, Romance",Becky Lewis,"Clara Chapman has fallen from high society, a woman about to be married;to a poor girl taking care of her invalid aunt. When an odd invitation comes, inviting her to spend the 12 Days of Christmas at Bleakly Manor in exchange for a goodly sum, Clara decides to accept the offer. However, things are not as they seem at the old,odd mansion. Other guests show up in hopes of a reward and the host is conspicuously absent.
Griep toys with the reader's mind as each guest is presented and well-drawn with both clues and secrets. I was glued to my chair as I tried to figure out what part each character would play in the mesmerizing drama. Or was I (and other readers)being intentionally sent on a red-herring chase?
Michelle Griep depicts the times, settings, and peoples well. She has proven herself a very versatile writer, able to perform well in whatever genre she chooses.
I appreciated the footnote early on that urges reader to see the back of the book for historical traditions. More historical fiction books could take a lesson from Griep.

,"Romance, New Adult, Sports and Games, Sports, Academic, College, Contemporary Romance",Katerina,"This isn't angsty. 7 years of separation during which they both aren't celibate because they believe the other left/destroyed the relationship.
I wasn't a total fan of the hero.
1. When he first took her virginity - no foreplay had me going wtf. Obviously it was ""amazing"" but idk, that bothered me.
2. Weeks after they've lost contact, he's spotted by the cameras kissing another woman. It's a ""publicity stunt"". However, why would he choose to do that as a public figure if he's waiting for Charlotte to come back to him, knowing she would see THAT. I don't know about you, but seeing my boyfriend kiss another woman wouldn't make me want to crawl back into his arms. I just hate it when ""smart"" protagonists act silly.
3. Why wasn't he more proactive in his search or the management of his career? Surely the love of your life wouldn't ghost and disappear without reason. She wouldn't just vanish. There must have been a reason. You'd think he would've personally taken that matter into his hands rather than handle it through a secondary figure like his agent and have her deal with a ""PI"".
4. A personal phone is a personal phone. I don't understand how his agent got her hands on that blocking Charlotte. This is the age of privacy and pins people!
5. Grayson didn't even ruin his agent. She's unprofessional. She cannot be in the industry. He should have sued the f*ck out of her. That would have told me that he really did take what she did personally, rather than simply firing her and letting her go. Seven years to demolish a relationship is a long time.
6. Charlotte moved out from her apartment around three weeks after he stopped responding her. He had time to visit her within then. Surely, he thought somethings wrong - let me go visit my girlfriend. I mean I am going to become an NFL star, I can afford it. Again, be proactive man.
7. As for the heroine. She had a miscarriage in their separation. She felt a lot of resentment across the years, and I personally thought it should have been tough not to transfer that onto him when they 'reacquaint' even if a third party was responsible for their relationship's demise. I felt pissed off on her behalf, so his sweet words wouldn't have cut it. She lost a child and she couldn't get a hold of him. That's a hard pill to swallow. Maybe, if he dropped to his knees in tears and THEN they made up over the past, I would have been happier. I'm honestly a sucker when hero's get emotional. It shows that its hit them hard.
8. Plus she knew who HE dated because obviously as a sports star, it was public knowledge, so, no I wouldn't have been upset if Craig turned up at Charlotte's door and Grayson had to witness the another man declare his love for her. Grayson was pretty cocky so I wouldn't have minded if his ego was taken down a peg or two.
9. I LOVE FRIENDS. Never felt love for a show the way I felt love for Friends. Grayson didn't like Friends. ðŸ˜‘

,"Media Tie In, Star Wars, Science Fiction, Fiction, Audiobook",Jack +Books & Bourbon+,"Damn but it's good to have Thrawn back in official rotation! Arguably the single best villain of the extended Star Wars universe, Thrawn was a character like no other, a cool, calculated, and supremely effective Grand Admiral in the typically blustery and barely competent Imperial Navy. And when Disney bought out everything Lucas, and the extended universe were removed from canon and made into ""legends"", many of us were saddened by the loss of this fascinating Chiss tactician.
But with appearances in both the animated Rebels series and this standalone novel, Thrawn is back in a big way. And while I haven't seen the Rebels episodes where he is featured, there's nobody that can write Thrawn like Zahn, and the novel Thrawn gives us the backstory we've been waiting and hoping for. Of course, Zahn created the character, so there's really nobody else that should be putting him to page. Anyone else just wouldn't do the character justice.
Let me get this out of the way now...I'm a huge Zahn fan when it comes to his Star Wars books, so whenever he releases a new one, I know without even a shadow of doubt that I'm gonna love it. I try to be impartial in my reviews, and I'll certainly do my best here, but it's going to be difficult. That said, I always try to keep spoilers to a minimum, so folks who haven't read the book yet can go in relatively blind.
So how does Thrawn stack up to the older Zahn books? Quite well actually. Obviously Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising, and The Last Command were much grander in scope, being (at the time) the official final Skywalker trilogy. So the focus was more on Luke, Leia, and Han, with Thrawn being their primary antagonist. The cool thing is, even though those books are no longer canon, Zahn has written Thrawn in a way that still fits with those original books. Since this is effectively a prequel, telling the story of Thrawn's first meeting with the Galactic Empire and his subsequent rise through Imperial ranks, it doesn't have to reinvent the wheel, and doesn't really have to retcon anything that's already been written. It also explains, in a roundabout sort of way, why Thrawn spent so much time in the outer reaches of space instead of with the inner system fleets. That said, because it's a self-contained novel, and exists to fill in the narrative background, it has a smaller scope than previous Thrawn tales. But that also allows for a more intimate look at the character, which helps paint him more as an antagonist than a true villain.
In keeping with the writing style from the previous novels, most of Thrawn isn't told from Thrawn's perspective at all. The majority of his growth within the Imperial Navy is witnessed/recounted by his aide/translator Eli Vanto. The other converging narration comes from Arindha Pryce, a private citizen who rises to prominence within the civilian bureaucracy of the Empire. For a while there, I wasn't quite sure how the narratives would mesh, but I needn't have worried, as Zahn had it well in hand.
Of the two main POV characters, Eli definitely has the lion's share of the story. This is a book about Thrawn, after all, and Eli is rarely far from Thrawn's side. The dynamic between Eli and Thrawn is terrific to read about, as Eli initially wants nothing to do with his new alien charge. In the very xenophobic Empire (both blatant and subtle), being assigned to an alien office is tantamount to career suicide...Eli knows it, and everyone around him knows it. Eli's very career hinges upon the success that Thrawn finds within the Imperial Navy, with everyone expecting the alien to fail. Fortunately, Thrawn is generally more than up to the task, and the relationship between the two men grows from ambivalence, to respect, to friendship. The good thing is, Eli is no slouch either, and coming from the wild reaches of space (ie underprivileged), has to fight against the prejudices of the core world elite. This gives both men a similar uphill battle against preconceived notions, further cementing their relationship. In fact, Eli's relationship with Thrawn is very similar to Captain Pellaeon's in the original Thrawn trilogy, viewing Thrawn as a mentor as much as a superior officer.
As for Arindha Pryce, her story takes a completely different track, but she crosses paths with Thrawn more than a few times in the book, with their interactions becoming increasingly heavy and impactful. The daughter of a miner family, Arindha rises to prominence in the civilian sector of the Empire, eventually ending up on Coruscant, and rising to political power. While Thrawn's rise is generally accomplished through logic and superior tactics, Arindha's is from a mix of tenacity, luck, and sheer audacity. I actually had an idea of how her tale was going to go, and it ended up going a different way entirely. So kudos to Zahn for making her character more than what she initially seemed to be.
As for the portions of the book themselves told strictly from Thrawn's perspective, they are few and far between, but they serve well in showing his superior analytic and people reading skills. But it's a good thing that Zahn kept these to a minimum, as a whole book with those continual observations would have been a tedious read.
Supporting characters are varied, a healthy mix of various Imperial officers, civilian government employees, a few adversaries for Thrawn to match wits with, some early rebellion forces, and maybe a guest appearance or two by a few Star Wars favs. But keep in mind that unlike some of the other recent Disney-owned Star Wars books, this is not a cameo heavy novel. Aside from Grand Moff Tarkin, cameos are used very sparingly, and with good effect. This is a good thing, as many Star Wars books (canon and legends both) had a tendency of throwing in cameos from as many fan favorite characters as possible, just to give the books that extra oomph. Which was not only wholly unnecessary, but was frequently annoying. Every author had a different take on how these core characters would act, and none of them quite gelled with the movie versions, so in the end you had some bastardized version of a character that didn't even need to be in the story, resulting in a narrative clusterf*ck. The mass appeal of Star Wars went well beyond the ""main"" characters, so throwing them into every single story only served to diminish the impact of any original characters being introduced.
One of the biggest compliments I can pay Timothy Zahn as an author is that I don't feel you have to be a Star Wars fan to get enjoyment out of his Star Wars books. This is especially true here. There are no Jedi or Sith, no lightsabers, and nobody is using the Force. This is very much a tale of the inner workings of the Empire, and the factors and circumstances faced by some its military and civilian members. Yes, it's Sci-Fi, but very broad and approachable Sci-Fi. Sure, there are a few space battles here and there, but for the most part it's a very character driven piece, using conversations and interactions to set the tone and propel the narrative.
Sadly, because this is a standalone novel, and isn't the size of Stephen King's unabridged version of The Stand, there are some segments that get glossed over. Thrawn and Eli are in the Imperial Academy together, but aside from a couple of notable exceptions, this section breezes by awfully quickly. Once they are in full Imperial service, there's a few instances of time jumps, usually around a year, and so Thrawn's ascendancy from Commander to Admiral, and then from Admiral to Grand Admiral, happen awfully quickly. There's also Thrawn's interactions with a certain sinister villain that ring kind of false, given the level of Thrawn's awareness and intuition. But these are really the only nitpicks I have against the book.
Ultimately, this is an relatively easy, fast paced read, chronicling the rise of the best tactical mind the Galactic Empire has ever known. While die hard Star Wars fans will get the most mileage from the book, any fan of Sci-Fi can find something to like here. And if you are in any way a fan of Thrawn, then you need to read this origin tale as soon as you can! (less)",Positif

,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Science Fiction",Cait â€¢ A Page with a View,"Ok I honestly had no idea what to expect from this (except that it was Marissa Meyer yay), so the whole thing was SUCH a fun surprise.
Ughhh this is one of those books where I'm going to fail miserably at explaining what it's about because I need to use my hands to map out the tangled web of identities and goals...
So Nova starts out with the ""villain"" Anarchists and Adrian is with the superhero Renegades, but Nova eventually goes undercover to try out for the Renegades. She ends up joining Adrian's superhero team and being a double agent... except it's really not that straightforward. Adrian and Nova are both keeping additional alter-egos a secret while maintaining both their superhero identities and regular personas within their team. Adrian and Nova's secret alter-egos are actually enemies (or at least out to get each other), but neither one of them knows that. And they are adorable together.
Actually, all of the characters are adorable! Oscar and Ruby were my favorites for sure. Marissa Meyer is just so good at showing the group dynamics of a bunch of teens so all of their unique personalities come through. Some of the fun banter totally reminded me of what I loved about The Lunar Chronicles. And the diversity was awesome here, too.
Basically, this book is just plain fun. It's a creative world full of so many different superheroes with every kind of power (it kind of reminded me of The Incredibles at times). But then plot got more philosophical at the same time and reflected a lot of relevant questions for our world.
For example, prodigies used to be persecuted, but then the Anarchists took down the system of oppression that only served a small group. Adrian remembers the gangs that rose to power in the absence of government in the Age of Anarchy and thinks the Renegade's current Council is better, but Nova's definitely there to take them down:
""The Council saw themselves as benevolent leaders attempting to solve all the problems of humanity, without any apparent grasp of how their involvement was only dooming society to helplessness and desperation.""
There's an ongoing debate between Nova & Adrian about whether it's in humanity's best interest to have superheroes protect society or whether that's an infringement on personal freedom or responsibility that makes people lazy & complacent. Nova believes that the ""system that was meant to protect and serve was nothing more than a failed social experiment"" because the Renegades weren't there to stop her family from being murdered when she was six. She thinks the people would be better off on their own than in a society run by ""dictators who had put themselves in this position of power without cause, and now had no idea what to do with it.""
So I just really appreciated how everything wasn't simplistic. There are groups with different views and goals even on the same side, which made the story more realistic.
I loved this story BUT definitely think it could've been about half the length. It took me a bit to get a feel for the whole world and what was even going on. I had issues with the pacing for sure... it kind of felt like I was waiting for the real story to get going? It could've been a lot more concise and powerful if the next book was part of this one. But I liked the concept and characters enough that my enthusiasm remains!

,"Fiction, Science Fiction, Dystopia",Taryn Pierson,"I shelled out cash for this book even though I could have waited on a library copy because I saw one too many white male reviewer say, â€œDo we really need another Handmaidâ€™s Tale?â€ and that is the kind of crap I feel compelled to answer with my wallet.
Because the answer to that supposedly rhetorical question is an emphatic YES. We do need more books like The Handmaid's Tale. Because news flash, whiny white guys, none of the stuff that Margaret Atwood was writing about and rebelling against back in 1985 has been fixed. So until that beautiful, blessed day finally arrives, I hope and pray that talented, gorgeous writers like Louise Erdrich will continue to churn out books that make us all confront the reality of the world we live in.
Also, are we really only allowed one heavy-hitting dystopian feminist novel? Is that a one and done situation? Because if thatâ€™s how publishing works, we are WAY over our quota of self-indulgent, navel-gazing novels by privileged white dudes. I think you guys can spot us one every 32 years.
And hereâ€™s something else to think about: Atwood has been criticized (rightly, in my opinion) for inadequately addressing race in The Handmaidâ€™s Tale. So can we admit it is possible that Erdrich, as a woman of color, might have something to add to the conversation around womenâ€™s rights that hasnâ€™t already been said by a white woman?
I donâ€™t think Future Home of the Living God is a perfect novel. Some key plot points are glossed over in a couple of lines, while multiple pages are spent dwelling on seemingly minor or irrelevant detail. It leaves a lot of loose ends lying around, which is uncomfortable in a book about so bleak a future. But the last two pages knocked me senseless with their stark beauty. This is absolutely a book worth reading, and Iâ€™ll fight anyone who says otherwise.

My Review:
While reading the latest addition to the Lost Kings series, I was smirking, gasping, and fanning myself through some highly erotic sensual scenes and enjoying the irreverent humor, salacious banter, family drama, and a ton of naughty fun - all sandwiched into an engaging storyline. The Lost Kings are an unusual MC in how they treat each other and their women, although they are still proud alphas, loud, boisterous, and able to handle their business. I was rolling right along and enjoying this smokinâ€™ hawt and lascivious MC romance packed with lewd and dirty talking yet sweet and quirky alpha men and their feisty women, when it came to a tense spot and then, just stopped. NO!
I am stamping my little foot, foaming at the mouth, spewing invectives and turning the air around me blue â€“ grrr! I was totally unprepared for an incomplete storyâ€¦ I must have closure! A pox on you Autumn Jones Lake for so thoroughly hooking me like a big mouth bass and reeling me in, only to hold me dangling over a cliff for another month for part two as I must know how it resolves. But, no question about it, I will be eagerly awaiting the next installment to hit my kindle. I have never worn a cut and would give anyone a crack to the head if they called me a muffler bunny, but I am most certainly a LOKI wannabe and Autumn Jones Lake fangirl. But for now, I am off to purchase voodoo doll supplies that resemble a certain author, as well as some extra sharp pins!

,"Fiction, Contemporary, Audiobook",Julie,"Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng is a 2017 Penguin Press publication.
A smart, but often scathing look at entitlement coupled with the endless dynamic layers between mother and child.
The Clinton era gets a sharp examination as we drop in on Shaker Heights, an ideal suburban community with plenty of unspoken rules for its financially comfortable residents. The Richardson family is the prototype of the community, with Elena Richardson embracing the lifestyle with unparalleled enthusiasm.
â€˜Perfection: that was the goal, and perhaps the Shakers had lived it so strongly it had seeped into the soil itself, feeding those who grew up there with a propensity to overachieve and a deep intolerance for flaws.â€™
By contrast, Mrs. Richardsonâ€™s new tenants, Mia and her daughter, Pearl, live a free spirited, nomadic life. Mia is a photographer, who works just enough to afford the basics in life. Pearl, though, has no trouble adapting to the stable home life of the Richardsonâ€™s, practically becoming a member of the family.
Things are working out well enough, until a chain of events unlocks long buried secrets, spawning a bitter custody battle, which exposes cracks in the Richardsonâ€™s perfect image, and will culminate in a fiery inferno, both physically and metaphorically.
This second novel by Celeste Ng is not quite as grim or heavy as her debut, but it is every bit as provocative.
I have had a hard time writing this review because the layers in this story are many, with so many themes to explore. I have worked on it for days, feeling slightly intimidated, unable to find the words that would do justice to such an outstanding novel.
|
This book adeptly explores hot button issues prevalent twenty years ago, between episodes of Jerry Springer and Clintonâ€™s sex scandals, when a different set of questions were raised, such as interracial adoptions.
â€œIt came, over and over, down to this: What made someone a mother? Was it biology alone, or was it love?â€
I was impressed with the various contrasts presented in the book, which included the mindset of the privileged juxtaposed against those who find themselves at their mercy. Was there an exacting price for that privilege and was it worth it? I must say, the judgmental hypocrisy is astounding!!
But, the heartbeat of the story is centered around motherhood. Every mother represented exposed that instant vulnerability motherhood creates. The pain of infertility and the frustrating process of adoption is examined right along with parental sacrifices and foibles and their consequences.
Mia and Mrs. Richardson's children also play an integral part in the story, their roles intertwined and connected in the most ironic of ways.
â€˜Izzy had the heart of a radical, but she had the experience of a fourteen-year-old in the suburban Midwest.â€™
One of the more interesting character studies is of Elena- mostly referred to as Mrs. Richardson, which I thought was a very clever way of hammering home a specific point. Her cluelessness, her arrogance, and relentless reproach is extraordinary in light of what is actually taking place.
Mia, in turn, may spark a little resentfulness in Mrs. Richardson, and despite my initial puzzlement about her, and I admit I certainly questioned some of her choices, I ended up respecting her a great deal.
So, as you can see, the novel is very driven by the characters, each offering a different perspective or new avenue in which to view the situation. Sometimes I felt deep empathy for one character, feeling the acuteness of their pain, but unable to choose a side. It is often heart wrenching and I found myself feeling torn on many occasions.
On other occasions, I had a very hard time mustering up any real empathy for a few of these characters.
The plotting was very tightly woven and on several occasions, I may have uttered an expletive out loud when misunderstandings exploded in the worst possible way, creating a mountain of tension in the process.
This is a very compelling family drama, drawing out a bit of nostalgia, prompting me to take a closer look in the mirror, to put myself in the place of others before passing judgement.
But, I also picked up on a bit of sarcasm here and there, almost as if the author was scoffing at some of the attitudes or the mindset of the era, although it was done so in an understated and sly way.
Itâ€™s been nearly a week since I finished the book and I still find myself mulling over the many layers and angles, and thinking about the characters and the choices they made and how it all came together in the end.
So, it is fair to say, this book has had an impact on me, and think it is a novel anyone who appreciates a well written, thought provoking work of fiction will appreciate. Highly recommend!!

,"Young Adult, Contemporary, Lgbt, Fiction",Warda,"But what the fuck was that ending? I am so confused! Was it supposed to be abrupt? Does it have a purpose?
Anyway, I enjoyed this book immensely. I love what it stood for. The overall message of living your life to the fullest. I wasn't the biggest fan of More Happy Than Not, but I appreciated the message behind this story so much.
Both characters, Rufus and Mateo know they are dying. They've received a call from Death-Cast letting them know they have less than 24 hours left to live. Everything now is a race against the clock. What would you do if you knew if you had little time left to live? What is it that you'd want to 'achieve'? Say to loved ones? Who would you want to be around?
It all took place in a day and it packed with all sorts of unpredictable adventures and storylines from different characters beautifully being woven into the original story. It was so clever. There was this hint of each person you meet or might not meet, you can have an impact upon, whether it be big or small. That all of our lives are connected somehow.
I so badly wanted more! It didn't feel complete. The ending was obviously intentional, but I can't wrap my head around it, neither do I see its value yet.
But, regardless, it is one of those books that will stay with you and have you reflecting deeply on life and what actually matters to you.

,"Science Fiction, Fantasy, Fiction, Time Travel, Historical, Historical Fiction",Roy,"3.5*
I usually enjoy Stephensons work and having read positive and negative reviews on this I was hesitant to start. It deals with an entire host of ideas. Quantum physics, time travel, history, witchcraft/magic, administration politics foundations just to name a few. The novel was divided into 5 parts and I thoroughly enjoyed Part 1 introducing the 2 main protagonists. It introduced the foundation for why magic was lost and what DODO briefly was. From there it became alot of backlog and info dumps that really didnt have much ti add to the story. In saying that chunks throughout the info dumps did feel important and were relevant but you had to wade through the lot to get there. The writing was great and witty at times, but it definitely felt like Stephensons lightest novel in terms of ideas. I would probably classify this as an urban scifi fantasy novel with historical aspects. The portrayal of red tape to promote and build an organisation was extremely well done ( tongue and cheek) however it was way too hefty/long in size. I think if it was 300 pages or so less, a little more concise in its direction, the authors may have created a 5 star reading. Will maybe continue the series if there is to be a 2nd book but will probably wait for reviews. (less)",Positif
,"Young Adult, Fantasy, Magical Realism, Romance",Irene Sim,"This reminded me so much of The Weight of Feathers. It has a similar Romeo and Juliet theme.
I had the author on my radar ever since I read her debut novel the love that split the world. I was really impressed with her writting and I couldn't wait to read her next story.
""A Million Junes"" prooved to be everything I was expecting from the author. It is heavier on the magical realism but that didn't bother me at all. EH creates a magical world, a place blessed by the Gods, a heaven on earth. But people with their actions turned it into hell and our heroine tries to save herself and her family from this curse.
I loved all the characters in the story, June's parents and siblings, her BFF Hannah, Saul and his cousin Nate, they all are solid, with their own purpose in the story.
If you have a taste for magical realism, I would recommend this book to you, it worths your time. (less)",Positif

Hey Logan?â€
â€œYeah?â€
â€œOne of these days . . . Iâ€™m going to save you back.â€
Oh.
My.
Swoons.
I can barely form a coherent thought right now. I'm a melty pile of swoony goo at the hands of Emma Chase. The woman is incapable of writing a book that I devour in one sitting with a goofy grin on my face for the entire time. As much as I adored Royally Matched, I think this book totally topped it. I don't have the words to describe all the ways I loved it. And oh my god, you guys, how I loved it!!!
Somebody once told me a slow-burning fire is the hottestâ€”and it must be true. Because Logan and I are a fucking inferno.
If you love an incredibly written slow burn romance with a hero that's simply to die for and a heroine you'll want for your best friend, this book will be going straight to your top favorites shelf. GUARANTEED. It wasn't just swoony, it was EPICALLY swoony. Logan owns my heart AND my ovaries. I don't ever want them back. EVER.
I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll be any fucking good at love. Iâ€™m not quite sure how itâ€™s done. But, for her, Iâ€™ll learn. And Iâ€™ll do my damnedest to get it right.
You may remember Ellie Hammond as Olivia Hammond's baby sister in Royally Screwed. Ellie has always been a bit of a free spirit. Sassy, a little quirky, optimistic and a bit naive in her youth, her brother in law feels like she needs someone to protect her when they're not around. And the only man he trusts for the job is royal guard, Logan St. James.
They first meet when Ellie is a senior in high school. The chemistry is there, but it's on a low simmer. Then over the years as Logan sees Ellie grow into a beautiful woman, that low simmer begins to turn into a sizzling inferno that proves almost impossible to resist.
I love a good slow burn romance, and this was easily one of my favorites. I love the playful nature that first forms between Ellie and Logan. I love the way he tries to deny his feelings for her while still falling in love with her. I love the way that Ellie goes after what she wants and I loved the way that Logan finally gives in. These two were some of the most endearing characters I've read in a while and I just couldn't get enough of them.
This book had everything you'd expect from the incredible talent that is Emma Chase; humor, witty dialogue, fantastic characters, and a romance that's so swoony, it may leave you in a pile of melty goo! This series is just perfection. It's my indulgence when I need a light and easy romance that will give me the warm and fuzzies and leave me with a smile on my face. Suffice it to say that I. LOVED. IT.

Every time we start a book, we all say a silent prayer it will take you on a journey that will compel you to immerse yourself fully. It doesn't matter the genre, troupe or style... I think the singular desire is to have a reading experience which won't allow you to put the book down until it is finished.
I am very lucky because I have had many experiences just like that... and some have come from this author, Katy Regnery. Ms. Regnery is one of those writers who plots out her stories in such a way... you are hooked from the start...and she slowly, quietly reels you in until you are so deep in her story you cannot think of anything else.
Unloved is a masterpiece in this style of writing. Regnery gave you everything to make you curious and rabid for this tale....The ideas of the Sins of the Father...a tortured son...and his feeling he is a ticking time bomb makes it hard to turn away. Combined this with a woman who has lost what she thought was the love of her life due to a Mass Murder at a concert/club. With the way things are today... reckless and unsure... It was not hard to suspend ones thoughts and say ok... I am with you...
This was written with such a sure hand. I am someone who has read many, many mysteries in the past... so figuring things out ahead of time happens more often then not...With this, though, Regnery had me thinking in overdrive.... I thought one thing then something else the next...and then she jerked me around to surprised the sh!t out of me....So there is that...
We get so much from this... the reality check of how we finally can let go of a loved one...Of what damage assumptions from others can do...with their not knowing anything about what they are accusing an innocent of...And then there is this complicated love story...it is pure, naive, intense, swoon worthy and fairy-tale like...
This is something very special and I think it is going to be talked about ...a lot. I am so thrilled I was able to read this and do it in one sitting... The Best.
Get ready to have an experience...one that will touch you.

,"Mystery, Fiction, Thriller",Sandy *The world could end while I was reading and I would never notice*,"This is my second Robert Dugoni book in a row. Previously I read In the Clearing, (Tracy Crosswhite #3), and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed The Trapped Girl far more.
The Trapped Girl is more tautly written; there is more suspense, more surprises, more of those delicious 'oh, I can't bear to put this down' moments, particularly in the second half of the book. Twists and turns in the plot were well done, and every time I thought I had it all figured out, Dugoni would throw in a new twist and we would be off on another tangent.
If this is how Dugoni's writing improves between books, I await his next offering eagerly.

,"Politics, History, Nonfiction, North American History",LemonLinda,"This book speaks to America's ""mission"" to promote and foster democracies globally before, during and after her tenure as National Security Adviser and as Secretary of State. She addresses that America has not always been perfect in offering freedom for all even within our own borders. And she also addresses mistakes made in working with other countries as we promote democracy while acknowledging that all democracies, including our own, have flaws and will never become the ""perfect union"", but that surviving and growing stronger is a never ending process. She refers to places when democracies are introduced in totalitarian countries, authoritarian nations, and quasi-democratic countries where democracies are new and struggling.
Some of her examples show attempts but complete failures, some show partial success and some are quite promising. She speaks to the recent histories of Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Kenya, Colombian, Iraq, Tunisia, Egypt, the Arab monarchies and others in her attempt to outline the ""long road to freedom"". She ends with addressing 2016 globally when America and others seemed to want to withdraw from responsibilities of the system they helped to create. And she warns that what she refers to as ""Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse - populism, nativism, protectionism, and isolationism - served neither democracy nor peace very well the last time (they were) around"".
She sums up her stories to freedom saying the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness can be achieved, but that ""that achievement involves taking a hard look at the realities facing Americans . . . . (and that) we are better off when we work to make this (pursuit) true not just for us - but for all humankind.""

Ollie lives with his brother Chris, who is a cop, because their parents died years ago. Ollie also works at the little grocery store.
I loved these two together, I can't say it enough. I also loved Makani's friends. But the main story is of Makani and Ollie. There is plenty of time for romance in between killings. Am i right? yes...

Once again, RC Boldt has shared a love story that gave me butterflies and massive smiles. I really enjoy the stories that I've read of hers so far. I loved Clam Jam and now I can add Out of the Ashes to that list! I am going to jump backwards and dive into Out of Love here soon because there is a character I want to ""meet"" in that book. RC Boldt is most definitely on my ""to read"" list now.
ALL OF THE CHARACTERS in this series are ones that I am most definitely excited to be reading more of. I really liked that she utilized ALL of them in this story too. The depth of her characters are really well done. I think it's safe to say that I want to read this entire series, from start to finish. I have fallen in love with Cristiano Hendrixson. Ok? I admit it! ""Hendy"" is a strong character with admirable traits and he has SO much confidence, but that confidence is marred by his physical appearance and the emotional side effects of what happened to him -- the left over results of being held a prisoner and tortured. What a life, right? And to make it back alive, but still have a constant reminder of your torture has to be a difficult thing to recover from. He is an absolute gentleman. He really was a huge draw for me in this book, and one of the things that made me swoon hard for him was that he was so strong and so alpha mixed into one complex character, but he was so soft and so perfectly sweet on Presley as well. Seriously, so swoony!!! I'm *SO* in love with him and the way he opened up and fell for her. The way he treated her like the princess she was in his eyes, it was so perfect!! So sigh-worthy. He was such a lovable character.
Presley found herself falling for her patient, yet morally bound to her fiancÃ©. Interesting storyline for sure and you know me...I love these kinds!! Well, it was a little more cut and dry than that, so no angst or nail biting happening on my end, but her fiancÃ© was 100% douche-nozzle material and I am so glad she saw that really quick. Parts of Presley's personality were strong and quirky, fun and admirable, but she had a loving side that was so strong and caring. She really is everyone's friend, and she was so fun to laugh with and laugh at. She, to me, was real and I liked that about her. I would most definitely like to hang out with her!
THESE TWO CHARACTERS had a journey that wasn't easily navigable and crossing a professional/moral boundary provided some drama for them to get through. With all their roadblocks, some feelings were hurt, but in the end it was worth the bumpy ride. I loved their relationship. I loved the dipping of the toes ever so slowly into the waters and the excitement behind a new relationship. I got all the smiles and giddiness from these two falling in love. I loved how they held back, but cautiously moved forward. I also felt the pain these two endured while trying to find their footing and trying to negotiate a relationship with all these hinderances. I just wanted to hug Hendy for everything he was going through....Boldt made it understandable and relatable, and heartbreakingly so.
This book was really really good.....and I know you are wondering why I have a 3.5 star on something that I can sing praises about and will easily and happily recommend. Well, I hate....I loathe....I detest made up drama or unnecessary drama in books. It is one of my pet peeves....drama for the sake of drama. This book did not have a ton of it and I am not saying that it did, but there was some added in that just made me roll my eyes while reading it. I know that Hendy is self-conscious about his scarring, and I know that causes some discord between him and Presley as well. It's a hard thing to accept and deal with, and knowing there are people out there that stare and ask questions, that adds to that self-consciousness on every level. What I don't get (and maybe it's just me) is that there are people that would honestly call him out and stand up to him, mocking him, taunting him on the streets? Again, maybe it's just the grown-up in me questioning why any adult would do this....but then to have them run away cowering? Doesn't make sense to me and didn't add value to the storyline in that manner. It's a trend I just don't like to see. I know it enforced his disgust for people to see his face the way it is, but it just struck me as odd, because it happened a few times and that was it -- but it's not an explorable avenue, so it's just a way to make me as a reader pissy. I don't like that, that's all. Personal preference.
And the other thing I honestly didn't enjoy was the over-used side-story of the parents of the main characters that try to dictate or govern their kids' life. Again, not super dominant in this storyline, but it still leaves a salty taste in my mouth. I'm most definitely over that trend because if you are strong in your every day decisions; you run your own business, fall in love, stand up to douche-nozzle men and have a beautiful confidence and make daily decisions in your own life.....why do you let your parents influence or cause problems in it? I just don't get it. I don't. I am *so* glad she had the inner-strength that she did. I found that to be very admirable. She made a decision and stuck to it; professionally and personally. Again, just personal preference.
I love RC's wit. I love her banter. I love the seriousness and the truths behind her characters. She writes everything I look for in a book that keeps me interested and continually turning the pages and seeking more. RC Boldt is definitely on my list of more books that have to be read. I am loving what I've read of her so far. She is a two-time win for me, and she is easily recommendable for me because she has a relatable ease to her storytelling and she makes me swoon while reading her love stories. Bring on Kane's story....I'm ready!!!! I'm hoping his story will be told in Out of Hope, the third book in this series. I need more. I want more. I will have more!!! I am loving these characters of hers!

Ah, Lawson and Jack are even 'perfecter' in this book. If you need some light and fluffy to make you feel better this is certainly an excellent option!
As ever Lawson is quirky, gloriously nerdy (and so sexy with it) and oh so hot once he gets going. (I love the dichotomy between his very organized and efficient self and his bossy bottom attitude!). I may be a little bit in love with him, too.
Jack is just a hero all the way round: sensitive and understanding,supportive and unselfish, and of course head over heels for Lawson. And he saves his life AGAIN. If you assume that this fact hints at more angst and lots of tension in this book - no need to fret. There are maybe a couple of chapters that are slightly worrying, but we all kind of know this is going to end well.
Maybe that is exactly what I missed. A little bit more of conflict. Some kind of real problem between them. There were possible scenarios - Lawson not wanting to move in with Jack (why on earth anyway, these two are as solid in their relationship as the 'best' of us!), Piers and all his intentions, a new job offer ....
I was heading for a 4 stars rating when the epilogue happened. Which is about the most perfect HEA you can imagine. I loved all of it. That was the epitome of cute and sweet and lovely in the best way! So no choice but up the stars! Which I obliged to more than happily!
N.R. Walker is a superstar when it comes to feel-good stories. And bringing the boys from Red Dirt Heat and Lawson and Jack together is a stroke of genius. Can't wait to read it!

,"Science Fiction, Fantasy, Fiction, Time Travel, Historical, Historical Fiction",Loring Wirbel,"Neal Stephenson proceeded directly from one of his more serious and technically challenging works, seveneves, to a rollicking multi-century spoof co-written with historical fiction author Nicole Galland. Stephenson and Galland had worked together along with five other authors on The Mongoliad Trilogy, though I'll admit I'm not familiar with the series. Funny that trilogies are involved with the Stephenson-Galland resume, however, because this book resembles nothing so much as the high-humor and faux-conspiracy Baroque Trilogy Stephenson authored a decade ago.
What is common in Stephenson's sober and technically-accurate tomes, and in his comical tall tales, is the tendency to push the plausibility of events right up to the limit. In seveneves or Anathema, that can get in the way of the storytelling, because the author tries so hard to make the science and engineering ring true, only to present events that seem close to implausible. In satire, we needn't worry so much, because we know in advance that every shred of reality is up for grabs.
The premise of The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O. reminds me of a question my daughter asked me in her latter high school years: ""Did miracles die off because people became more science-minded and realized they never existed in the first place, or did science chase the miracles away?"" Stephenson and Galland chronicle the rise of a new federal intelligence agency (and bureacracy) under the auspices of IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency, a real thing), which is tasked with the mission of ""bridging the magic gap."" As all good scientists and historians know, magic officially died in July 1851, having been placed on its death bed by the Industrial Revolution. A specific event related to the perfection of photography finally put all witches out of business, and it is the job of DODO (you'll have to read the book to learn the acronyms) to bring them back.
Stephenson and Galland develop a rather interesting theory of witchcraft, related to Schrodinger's Cat and Hugh Everett's many-worlds theory. Suffice it to say that probability wave fronts have particular ways they tend to collapse, and their collapse into actuality at different break points creates multiple universes, and multiple ""strands"" of the history we know. Witches develop ways of manipulating the probability waves to fall in one way or another, a ""summoning"" of spells. There is a lot of overlap in the bewitching language of this novel and Mark Z. Danielewski's The Familiar series: ""Scrying,"" ""familiar,"" ""glamour"" and ""glimmer"" used in a wiccan context, etc. Witches certainly don't know probability influencing and many-worlds in a quantum sense, but they have yarn or broom creations (like the South American ""quipa"") that allow them to hand-calculate, abacus-style, how the casting of a spell might influence possible futures on possible strands. One must avoid at all costs the notion of ""diachronous shear,"" when multiple universes approach each other with logically implausible scenarios, and the universes die a mini-death at a particular place and time, like the local collision of matter and anti-matter.
I'd be willing to bet that Galland influenced Stephenson to not get too heavy in the early portion of the book, and to explain the connection between Schrodinger's Cat and witches' spells with a light-hearted cartoonish aura resembling Mr. Peabody of Bulliwinkle fame. A reader with a firm background in science fiction might roll eyes at first, until discovering the entire book carries a cartoonish tenor, and is never to be taken too seriously.
We watch how federal bureaucracies arise and become infected with civil-service mundane action, all with the forementioned cartoon silliness. The book takes place in an alternate universe in which the Pentagon is called the Trapezoid, but the character-types are all too familiar, albeit drawn in the hyper-exaggerated manner of Dr. Strangelove. And of course, the time-travel is wild and woolly, filled with the accuracy Galland can provide, as we hop from a tenth century Norman village to Constinople in 1203, during the Fourth Crusade, to Elizabethan England in a hyper-paced search for witches. And, without providing too many spoilers, the intelligence-agency meddlers must avoid events leading to diachronous shear, such as allowing too many people to know that Christopher Marlowe might not have died in that infamous barroom brawl. The federal effort to exploit magic is not merely to spend taxpayer money - what happens in Constantinople, and in the Seljuk and Ottoman empires to follow, could have a big bearing as to whether Russia occupies the Crimea and invades eastern Donbas in 2014. Or could it? It all depends on which strand one is on.
The bulk of the book is written from the perspective of Melisande Stokes, a linguist and ancient culture specialist from the 21st century, left stranded in 1851. Thanks in part to Galland's influence, much of the book is written from the perspective of women, from witches and would-be witches to the very un-magical Stokes. It is a great perspective from which to observe the folly of men that are responsible for creating much of the nation's, and world's, military-intelligence bureaucracies. The authors intersperse Stokes' diary with government memos and handwritten notes in different typeface, moving the story forward in the manner of the graphic insertions used by Reif Larsen, Garth Risk Hallberg, and many other modern novelists. Some readers may find this makes the story too nonlinear, I tend to love this, and hope it is used to greater extent, as in Danielewski's series.
There are times when elements seem very over the top, as in the Viking invasion of a Lexington, Mass. Walmart, but let's remember the absurd adventures of Jack and Company, sailing around the world in the 17th-century Baroque Trilogy. Stephenson is a master at moving way, way beyond the boundaries of what could be. A reader either gets used to that, or dismisses Stephenson as the biggest boaster at the bar. Since I started reading this novel knowing it to be a fairy tale, I figured no pushing of the reality boundary was a bridge too far.
There are few hidden terrors or moral lessons in this book, as there are in many Stephenson and Galland works. The conclusion is a little bit too melodramatic, and too many good-guys win in the end -- or at least, we think they do in a conclusion that leaves room for a sequel. But the Hungarian witch, one of the strong supporting actresses in the novel, leaves readers with a suggestion that must be hard for the scientifically-inclined to make, and hard for Stephenson to suggest as well. As a new battle emerges between those who would kill the scientific method to preserve witchcraft, and those who think that the death of magic was an acceptable bargain to gain 21st-century technology, Erszebet the Witch reminds us that nature does not care if the Enlightenment or the world of magic and fairy-tales wins in the end. There are different ways of perceiving and interacting with the natural world. We children of the Enlightenment who are used to the universality and predictability of the scientific method may wish to think that a scientific understanding is naturally preferable to living in superstition and fear. But the death of magic brought with it the end of the summoning of probability waves, the end of glimmer and scrying. Maybe, just maybe, science and witchcraft have equal benefits to bring to the party. At the very least, witchery brings us bone-chilling terror from time to time, and can also be the source of some silly cartoon-style fairy tales, of which D.O.D.O. is a perfect example.

,"Mystery, Fiction, Thriller, Crime, Mystery Thriller",Frosty61,"I was disappointed in this one. The plot started out promising but then it got bogged down; the author was 'preachy' on the subject of illegal immigrants; there were too many characters and too many rogue groups of nasty people; the setting was dismal. I wish the author had just told an entertaining story without all the stilted dialogue to educate the reader on the topic of illegal immigrants. We're smart enough - we could get the point without having it shoved down our throats. All in all, the story barely held my interest though I read to the end in the hopes that the tone would change and the ending would make it worth my time. Nope. I'm tired of authors and famous people in general trying to rally the rest of us to support their causes, but that's a rant for another place/time. (less)",Netral

DNF @ 37%
I wasn't enjoying this and life is too short.
Honestly I feel a little bit bad about DNF'ing this one, and seeing that many people have enjoyed it, I feel like I might just have commitment issues, but I promised myself that I wasn't going to do anything that I don't fully enjoy, and that includes reading.
What I read up to 37% wasn't bad, but I found myself skim reading through a lot of the inner monologues of the characters, and that's where I know it's bad for me. Listen, I am okay skim reading or entirely skipping action scenes or descriptions, but you have to have me hooked on the characters and what's going through their heads. If you don't do that,
Furthermore, I had issues with the world building.
Here is a list of things within this book that I would not expect from a society in which if you have no Skill (~Magic) you have to serve 10 years as a slave:
â€¢ you can choose whenever to serve your 10 years. Like, literally you could postpone it until you're old and about to die and screw the system into taking you to serve your years when you're useless and can't do shit.
â€¢ until you do your 10 years you're a class B citizen, but other than that you can work, have a family, can lead a pretty normal life. Sign me the fuck up for postponing my slavery until I'm almost on my deathbed please??
â€¢ the society doesn't seem to be all that different than our in terms of mentality.
â€¢ people don't seem to be completely brainwashed into the whole I'll have to give 10 years of my life to slavery because of reasons. The characters seemed to jump from ""We all know we have to serve and that's okay"" to ""Oh no this sucks I don't want this"" with no internal struggle whatsoever, and they only seemed to go from one mood to the other to serve the plot.
â€¢ probably something else I'm forgetting because I started this book one week ago and read like 3 other things in the meantime
The only reason I didn't DNF'd this sooner is that one of the characters seemed really interesting and I was hoping to see more of him (I thought he might be a bit of a Laurent-from-CP character?), but sadly his PoV was only shown once so far and the idea of suffering through the rest of the book just to see where this character would go seemed like a bad life choice, and frankly,

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction, War, World War II",Colleen Turner,"I fully admit that when I see a new Susan Meissner book is coming out I get a little squeaky with joy. This is true to the point that, after having joined a ""street team"" to read, review, and promote her previous two books - Secrets of a Charmed Life and Stars Over Sunset Boulevard - I reached out to her this year to see if I could join the team again. While she wasn't going to do the same sort of thing this time around she did generously offer to send me a copy (and she even signed, it, which made it extra special!). It was a bit of a waiting game for me to be able to fit it into my review schedule but once I did I sat back and prepared to enjoy this newest ride back and forth through history.
In A Bridge Across the Ocean we get to experience both present day California and WWII Europe, America, and the great open ocean aboard the RMS Queen Mary. Susan Meissner's ability to fully carve out both a present and past storyline within one overarching story, tying everything together in some way by the end, has always fascinated me and continued to do so with this story. So often when I read a dual timeline book I favor one over the other (usually the historical storyline) but with Ms. Meissner's writing I tend to really enjoy both equally, with lessons and heartache and hope found in all corners of the story no matter where or when it takes place.
For this particular novel I found Brette's journey in present day California quite unique. She's able to communicate with those she calls ""Drifters"" - basically people who have passed away but not moved on to their final destination and, instead, drift around as ghosts searching for some sort of assistance - but has grown up trying to stifle this ability and pretend it doesn't exist. However, when she goes aboard the RMS Queen Mary, now docked at Long Beach, she is forced to face a Drifter that desperately needs her help and whom she feels, for the first time, that she actually wants to help. This journey leads her not only into the depths of our other storyline but to the discovery that, by always letting fear and uncertainty cloud her ability to let go and experience the life she's been given to the fullest, she will never be truly happy. Beyond these lessons I absolutely love ghost stories and the descriptions of Brett's interactions with these Drifters were delicious and eerie and I only wish there had been more of them!
During the portions of the book where we travel back to WWII and directly after, the tone of the story shifts markedly. There is so much pain and loss for not only Simone and Annaliese, our two main protagonists, but for all the secondary characters we meet as well, and seeing them move past that heartache for the hope of a brighter future was inspirational. The backstories for both Simone and Annaliese were quite sad and I so enjoyed watching their interactions and trying to discover how they would arrive at the point that one of them wouldn't make it off the Queen Mary when it arrived in New York. I will mention that we learn pretty early on which woman doesn't make it off the ship in New York, which was slightly disappointing as I was hoping for more of a mystery, but learning the how's and why's of that discovery was still enjoyable.
Probably my favorite part of the novel was the time spent on the RMS Queen Mary (in both timelines). The boat sounds so beautiful and has so much history behind it that I would have enjoyed even more time spent digging into the depth of it's history. I loved learning about the daily life of a war bride traveling on the boat and really wish more time was spent getting to know those other women and their stories, especially Simone and Annaliese's roommate, Phoebe, who I felt was a little overlooked as another potential important and interesting piece to the story. And, as I said before, I loved the ghosts that Brette discovered as she moved through the labyrinthine world of the boat and tried to put together the pieces of what happened onboard so many years before.
The only thing I didn't really enjoy about the story (other than wanting more from some of the secondary characters and more mystery regarding what happened on the boat in 1946) was the final realization as to who the Drifter was that led Brette to Simone's and Annaleise's story. For me it came off as somewhat of an odd letdown, but this in no way detracted from my overall enjoyment of the story. I will also add that I wish there was an author's note at the end of the story that gave more facts regarding war brides and their journey to America, but I have an advanced reader's copy so that might be included in the final printing.
A Bridge Across the Ocean continued my appreciation of Susan Meissner's writing and once again brought new parts of history, as well as interesting contemporary perspectives, to my attention. While I can't say that this was my favorite of her novels I can say that it was a wonderful and entertaining read and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys dual timeline novels and interesting and complicated characters.

4.5 stars!!
This is my first read from Michael Robotham. I loved it!
How far would you go to create the perfect family?
How many times have you looked at someone and thought ""now there is someone who has it all?"" Well I have. Plenty of times.
We may assume someone who is beautiful, rich, married with children must be happy. They must have the perfect life. But you know what they say about assuming....
The book alternates between Agatha and Meghan's point of view.
When Agatha looks at Meghan she sees someone with the perfect life. She has a gorgeous home, two beautiful children, and a loving husband. While Agatha is at home, pregnant and alone, wondering if her baby daddy, Hayden will ever return her calls. Hayden is a sailor who is away for seven months. Agatha tells us the silly boy ""thinks"" they broke up before he left, but she says he's just overreacting to her going through his phone and reading his emails. Now he's avoiding her.
But she'll find a way to make him reply to her.
Agatha is pregnant and works at a grocery store in an affluent area in London. Her favorite part of the day is when Meghan comes into the store.
Agatha knows A LOT about Meghan's life. She knows her schedule, husband and children's names, as well as what time Meghan picks up her daughter from school. She knows Meghan's mothers' group meets every Friday morning and even what each woman orders to drink. She's gotten a lot of this information by watching Meghan. But she also gotten a lot of additional information from Meghan's detailed posts on her mommy blog. She thinks Meghan makes motherhood and marriage look easy.
But Meghan's life is far from perfect. Her marriage has been very bumpy lately. Jack has been acting strangely, and the couple has been fighting more than ever (more than once I wanted to reach into the book and throttle Jack, when he made comments about her weight or belittled her blog). Meghan hopes that once the baby is born things will go back to normal, that they will be happy again.
But Meghan has secrets...and she's not the only one.
So many secrets.
Agatha finds out that Meghan is pregnant with baby number three and that they are both due around the same time. This gives her the push needed to strike up a conversation with Meghan. But Meghan doesn't know that this little conversation has solidified a friendship (in Agatha's mind). If Meghan only knew that a seemingly unimportant conversation with a woman stocking shelves at a grocery store will turn her life upside down in ways she never imagined.
""I've spoken to her properly now. We've made a connection. We're going to be friends, Meg and I, and I'll be just like her. I'll make a lovely home and keep my man happy. We'll do yoga classes and swap recipes and meet for coffee every Friday morning with our mothers' group""
If only Meghan hadn't gone to that store. If she'd done anything different that day. Maybe that would have changed everything.
This book got inside my head. So many twist and turns that literally had my mouth dropping open in surprise. I was so fully engrossed in the story that I didn't see the time passing. I had an early appointment the next morning and wanted to get to sleep early. But I couldn't stop reading!
We really have no idea what goes on in someone's life. How things that happened throughout their lives can affect everything. I was trying to put myself into the minds of these characters. All of the horrible things some had been through. Some parts were very difficult to read.
How do we know what someone's marriage or relationship is truly like. Just look at how happy everyone is on Facebook and other social media. So often we are just seeing just the parts they want us to see.
This was a gripping and powerful story full of thrills, twists, and mind games. And although occasionally things may have seemed implausible, I just went with it and enjoyed the story.
THE SECRETS SHE KEEPS is a clever and entertaining psychological suspense novel that I quickly devoured in just a few sittings.
I can honestly say this won't be my last read from Michael Robotham
Thank you NetGalley and Scribner Publishing for providing an advanced copy of this book for me to read in exchange for my honest review. (less)",Positif
,"Contemporary, Young Adult, Fiction ",Kathryn,"""Everyone may be unhappy in their own way, but at least we can all be unhappy together. That way we aren't alone.""
The Temptation of Adam was another happy surprise. I thought I would like it but I didn't think I would love and adore it. I fell for these characters and their flaws. I learned about them and myself at the same time. Mr.Connis posed a lot of questions in the book through his writing that I myself was trying to solve along with the characters. He has a knack for words and storytelling truly. I love how flawed these characters were but still so lovable at the same time. The pace was really good because I flowed right through it. It was a contemporary that I felt really made you sit back and go, ""huh I didn't think of it in that way."" I also loved how somethings were so relatable like how stupid a question like ""are you ok?"" is when the person is very obviously not ok. I really loved this book so much and I recommend it many times over to contemporary lovers especially but everyone in general.
""We're all born in chaos, and I don't think it ever goes away. We just get better at learning how to find beauty in it.""
What I Liked
1) Plot
""I'm not as strong as you, but I'll keep singing if you keep writing the words.""
This is a story of a lot of messed up people who are just trying to navigate through life and I cried, laughed, smiled, and felt pure joy while reading this. This can be a triggering book for anyone battling with addiction, suicide, and mental health so please take that warning into consideration. But, with that said nothing was graphic or done in poor taste the author handles all three extremely well. This is the story of Adam Hawthorne who is the opposite of fine. His mom walked out on his family, his dad is clueless to his life, and he tends to turn to porn instead of actually dealing with his feelings. Adam starts out as someone who refuses to acknowledge his issues but when something happens at school that almost gets him expelled, he's forced into an intervention program headed up by one of his teachers. In this program, he meets other addicts, namely the Knights of Vice, who eventually become his friends and one maybe a bit more. What I loved about the plot of this book was how Dave Connis approaches the issue of addiction head on but in a way that makes it difficult to judge the characters for their addiction. Music also plays a HUGE role in the book but I don't want to spoil anything.
2) Writing
""We are all just dirt with legs. All of us. We may think we aren't, but we are.""
The writing for this book was actually exceptional. It was relatable yet metaphorical yet not overly flowery. It was incredibly hilarious. The family dynamics, the friendships, the emotional talks, the angry talks all made sense and flowed in a natural way that worked with this book. This book was immensely quotable and I really felt I could connect with it even if you're not someone that struggles with an addiction or mental health. I felt the author took great care in this topic and with these characters and building them out in a way that was tasteful and not just for shock-value.
3) Characters
""In this moment, I think I feel everything, but I feel her so specifically, I can't define how.""
My favorite thing about this book was all the character development from everyone. It was really beautiful to see especially because it didn't end unrealistic with all addictions eradicated and happily ever afters. The characters were real and raw. We saw their major battles, their highs and lows, and how even in the end you won't ever be completely beyond the addiction but it will always be something you fight for and work on. You will have good days and bad days. Adam was funny, sarcastic, smart and battling porn addiction. Dez was witty, funny, closed off and a multi-layered addict. Addy was Adam's sister, smart, sweet and loving in everything. Trey was funny, strong hearted, deep and a sex addict. Elliot was emo, kind, quiet and a self-harmer (only mentioned not graphic.) Mr. Cratcher is the teacher and a man with a painful past who wants to teach his student what he wishes he knew. Adam's dad is a man who is torn by his failed marriage and trying to be a dad again.
4) Romance
""I need these guys, and they need me. A person's hurt can't be divvied up, but it can be experienced together, and maybe that's what I need to survive.""
The romance in the book is cute and angsty. It is two addicts trying to navigate their life and love. It's a battle that they Adam and Dez have to work through and it is something that helps them learn about themselves and their problems. I like how it wasn't instant love but it wasn't slow burn either. It was a happy medium and I just rooted for them the whole time with their cute banter flaws and all.
More Quotes
""I'm sorry,"" she says, her voice scratchy and slurred. ""If you'll have me, it'd be a pleasure to burn with you."" ""Yes, please,"" I say.
""Once you know what you are, you are no longer a human who struggles with addiction, but a human who struggles with being human.""
""I realized that if change weren't possible, racial segregation wouldn't have been declared illegal. If change weren't possible, my friends wouldn't be turning into damn good men. If change weren't possible, love wouldn't have been a reason that made me want to stay alive.""
""I might never be fixed, but that doesn't mean I can't be whole. We're all variables of broken and holy light, and that's the only thing about the world that doesn't change. Addictions can never define Dez and me because they'll never have the chance. We're never just one thing, but we can always choose to love. And that's how we blaze.""

,"Children, Picture books, Humor",Sasha,"I got a peek at the book on Mac Barnett's iPad when he came to the Library to do a program (best day of my professional and book reader life ever). It's just so good. Jon Klassen's art is somehow even better than before, with so much depth and texture in the deceptively simple scenery. The colors are neutral, but what could have been boring and dreary in another's hands is instead whimsical, intriguing, adorable.
And the facial expressions of the titular character and his friend/maybe frenemy Square. I was cackling. Real talent right there, making federal employees cackle in public.
As for the story.. what can I say, it's Mac Barnett. It's funny and clever and eyebrow-raising. There is mischief, revenge, friendship, deception, prideful posturing, and adventure. And shape-related mysteries.

,"Fantasy, Dragons, Romance, Paranormal, Paranormal Romance, Shapeshifters",Sarah Toussaint,"Okay. So as I went down the reviews for this, I saw a lot of readers complaining about the heroine.
I was actually surprised because I liked this story, SPECIFICALLY because of the honesty, wittiness, sarcasm and surprisingly, the ""realness"" that the heroine brings to a story about a fucking dragon.
I'm sorry, but to the readers who complain about how often the heroine was untrusting of the dragon or wasn't immediately giving into the dragon's advances, makes me realize even more just how awfully misogynist we are in the book-world as readers.
Our heroines get criticised for the lamest shit while our heroes get away with nearly everything.
I mean, honestly, imagine you were left naked, outside in a post-apocalyptic world, and a fire-breathing creature approaches you. Would you immediately throw your arms around it and offer your body to it?
No!
So why are we suggesting that the heroine does this?
I actually love the story because the heroine wasn't quick to trust the creature.
Trust wasn't just given. It was earned and the dragon had to work for it.
The story is pretty much carried out by this heroine. She is 85% of this book, she basically tells us the story, and we only get the dragon's POV some of the time.
So, if you don't like the heroine, you won't like the book. Lol
I absolutely loved the way the story was narrated, the heroine brought a sense of realism with the way she cares for her sister and her friend and worries about her world but still is strong enough to survive in it. She acted in certain situations the way I personally think most people would act.
It makes you feel like this would really happen in the world we live in. And this book makes you hope to be as strong and as vibrant as the heroine if your own world ever comes crashing down, or well, if the sky ever opens up and dragons come spilling out.
You connect with two characters who are awesomely developed. Kael and Claudia are two different entities from two very different worlds but somehow, you believe they belong together.
The way Claudia strives to preserve her life and her family's above all things.
I admired that.
She eventually falls in love with the dragon but it was all in good time. It all made sense and the plot progressed fairly.
Now, when it comes to the story, I don't know if it's ever been done before, as I've rarely read books like these, but it was novel and interesting to me.
I mean, the closest I've come to reading and actually liking books about shifters is reading the Suzanne Wright's books.
I've always wondered why people seem to just ignore the ""bestiality"" undertone of those type of books so I always feel kind of weird reading about them. Lol
I'm definitely going to read more of this writer's work because I love her writing. It's really easy to follow and her characters have substance, even the non-human ones.
This is definitely going to put in my ""favourites"" pile here on Goodreads. (less)",Positif

,"Mystery, Crime, Fiction, Thriller, European Literature, Scandinavian Literature",Shane Harrison,"I thought I'd never finish this book. It is was too long and too gruesome. Much as I have loved the Harry Hole series, I doubt that I will follow it any further. Nesbo is, I think, aware of being stuck in a rut and, in recent episodes, has fiddled with the concept of Harry's demise. Unfortunately, I think he has painted himself into a corner and is grasping for ever more outrageous solutions to dig him out. Fundamentally I find the serial killer to be a poor focus for a murder mystery unless attached to an interesting and coherent motive. Unless, perhaps, you have created Hannibal Lechter. Valentin is simply trite and nasty, his continuation from Police being a poor idea. The set-up for another sequel is laboured and predictable; it's gone time when Nesbo should have broken free of this cycle. After the disappointment of Police, great for the most part but becoming too convoluted by the end, The Thirst has crossed the line. In its nastiness it is transgressive, failing to achieve the catharsis of previous works in the series. It also, most damningly, fails to suspend disbelief â€“ I don't buy much of what passes for plot here. Nesbo is still a fine writer, but he needs to get back in touch, with humanity, with himself and with Harry Hole. (less)",Netral

Shannon Hale's Real Friends was a Reading Without Walls challenge for me. That is, as a child and still today, I'm not much of a group person, most likely related to my introversion. From childhood on I can recall being part of groups of people I liked, but they almost always wanted to spend way more time together than I did. Shyness is probably also a factor as we moved a lot and so I was never in a school more than three years. This made me happy to find just a single friend. Now Shannon wanted this too, but in her case the single good friend always seems to be tied to bigger group politics which was not my experience. So I wasn't gravitating to read this one, but did because of Gene's challenge and because this is so much the reality of many children and especially my students.
That is, I've been a classroom teacher for decades and have observed and helped kids navigate friendships throughout that time. Sometimes it is one person snubbing another, sometimes it a group thing (with the popping up of clubs always a sign that someone is probably being excluded), sometimes it is sweet and lovely, and sometimes it is mean and vile and intractable. And so while I didn't read Real Friends for nostalgic or personal reasons, I did read it because it was so real and raw in terms of many children's reality.
Shannon's description of the ups and downs of friendship and, especially, the complicated dynamics of groups and popularity are vividly and honestly done. For kids for whom this resonates this book will be a life-saver, something that will speak to them, that they will see themselves in. Or perhaps they are yearning to be part of a group --- this may help them understand it isn't necessarily nirvana. I appreciated that Shannon isn't represented as perfect when part of a group by any means --- she doesn't do the usual forgiving of one culprit, she doesn't significantly help another bullied child (authentically being too self-absorbed in her own woes to do more than recognize her and talk to her when they are thrown together). Kudos to Shannon for being so authentic and real and honest. As an adult, I found the family dynamics most potent, especially her relationship with her big sister. Shannon doesn't hold back and, boy, is some of it rough. Fortunately, there seems to be the start of a better understanding at the end and more in the afterward that is reassuring for any who worried about Wendy.
A piercingly honest view into the complicated social life of one young girl that is certain to resonate for all who have observed, participated, or otherwise experienced the difficult dynamics of school friendships.

This book was OK, not great, not even very good. I've read all the Ice Planet Barbarian books but I don't remember Chloe at all. I haven't read the Fireblood Dragon books so any tie in was lost on me.
Chloe was sent to prison because she killed the alien that bought her as a sex slave. The aliens bonded on 3 so when Chloe killed one pervert nine of them died. Jutari is an assassin that got caught. He had the means to leave the prison but didn't act on it until he saw Chloe. I didn't get that at all. The prison was awful.

Reading the description for the book and seeing the awesome cover (you all know by now that Iâ€™m a sucker for a great cover) I knew I needed to read this! THE DRIVER by Hart Hanson â€“ the mind behind the TV show Bones â€“ was a great thriller. It had all the elements you love, but with a touch of humor. Usually that doesnâ€™t sound like a good combo, but Hansom meshes them flawlessly and made for an incredibly enjoyable read.
Michael Skellig is a limo driver and heâ€™s waiting for his client outside of an upscale hotel. His current client is a skateboarding mogul, Bismarck Avila and his bodyguards. Skellig is also the owner of the limo company and he, along with his group of employees, is a veteran. Specifically an Army Special Forces sergeant and his training kicks in â€“ something changes in the wind causing him to think one thing: troubletroubletrouble. He goes running in to get Avila and just in time, because two Chechen gunman attack and kill one bodyguard and put Skellig in the hospital.
When he wakes up in the hospital he finds himself in custody and is the only person of interest in this murder. Things get complicated when Detective Delilah Groopman from the LAPD gets involved â€“ someone that Skellig has always been fond of. Avila is willing to help clear Skelligâ€™s name but only if he becomes his personal chauffeur â€“ seems like a great gig? Well, Skellig would like it a lot more if his client wasnâ€™t obviously a target for murder. Will he be able to clear his name and save Avila?
I loved the writing. While some people might find it to be overly descriptive or, at times, too comical, I felt that it worked very well for this book! Itâ€™s a very uniquely written thriller and made for a quick read! I love when thrillers and mysteries have all of the elements we love but also have something that sets them apart. The characters were great and the mystery was there to keep the pages turning. The relationships and interactions between the characters were genuine and showed how unique they all were â€“ with most being wounded veterans, Hanson presents the different mental effects very well. There were some violent parts towards the end, so that added to the thriller elements we know and love (sometimes).
Overall, I loved the added humor. I know that wonâ€™t be for everyone, so if you arenâ€™t looking for a thriller with a lot of laughs thrown in, then youâ€™ll want to move on. Hart Hanson perfectly meshes comedy with mystery!

A Girl Like Me by Author Ginger Scott is book two in the Like Us Duet. It is not a standalone and should only be read after A Boy Like You.
""...youâ€™ll never be at peace until youâ€™ve turned over every rock in your journey.â€
When I began reading A Girl Like Me, I was already on edge, pondering what was to come and hopeful that my what I conjured in my mind from book one was possible. I felt like I had prepared myself for whatever the outcome, but I had not.
""I am the girl who wants to dive over the edge, the girl who demands to taste the wild sideâ€”and when I feel itâ€™s close, I let it take me completely.""
This was a complete masterpiece of YA literature. From Chapter One until The End, I was engulfed in a story that had me wrapped around its little finger. Reading the words made me feel excited, hopeful, scared, angry. I went through so many emotions and was completely undone. The suspense had me strung tight. The information overload was exciting and invigorating, launching a series of questions to form that churned again and again in my head. I needed all the answers!
""This is that rare moment where a girl and a boy are ready for something, in a way it was probably always supposed to be. Those other times, those other boysâ€”those were all regrets now, because thisâ€¦this is special.""
I love that this book displayed characters with great strength and fortitude. Wes and Joss continued to be individuals that enchanted me. Not only this, but their ability to look adversity in the face and overcome it, in spite of the obstacles, was inspirational.
""Wes Stokes means more than anything ever has, other than my own dreams. And right now, the two run parallel.""
There was also a special component to this story that was so different than anything Iâ€™ve ever read from Ginger Scott, and let me just tell you that she excelled in her writing. I was in awe of the storyline that was crafted in such a clever manner and encompassed a world of hopes and dreams in the time of oneâ€™s existence. It brought about a sweet, passionate, and all-consuming love that outsmarted fate.
â€œI know you donâ€™t need a hero, Joss. You are the strongest person I know. Even so, I canâ€™t help myself. I never could. And not because someone told me I was supposed to, either.â€
Exquisite, surreal, and awe-inspiring, A Girl Like Me showcased a boy and girl who became a young woman and young man that defied the odds and made their own story. It was the read of a lifetime.

This is a fantastic, suspenseful science fiction mystery novel that balances intrigue, excitement and the ethical challenges that emerge with technological advancements.
The premise behind this novel is fantastic. Essentially, the author designs a futuristic version of the traditional closed-room mystery by placing the story on an isolated ship in deep-space with a very small crew. This is such a refreshing take on the traditional mystery setup.
The novel starts out strong, with a gripping first chapter that is guaranteed to pull the reader into the mystery. The characters wake up without recent memories, placing the reader in the same ambiguous situation.
The story is told from multiple perspectives, shifting between the six crew members. These characters are all unique, diverse and fully developed people. It quickly becomes apparent that everyone has a murky past and plenty of secrets to hide. The chapters shift between the current timeline and flashbacks, slowly providing the reader with insight into the backstories of each character. All of the crew members are suffering from large gaps in their memories, which sets up a situation with six unreliable narrators. Essentially, the reader cannot trust any of the characters, because even the characters are uncertain of their own innocence. Along the course of the novel, the author slowly provides the pieces necessary to solve this intricately-plotted murder mystery.
The writing is strong, with clean, simple prose. I found the world building was understandable and easy to follow. Likewise, the technology was relatively straight-forward, including well-established future technology like food replicators and artificial intelligence. Other research discussed in the novel involved advancements in technology that already exists today.
I originally expected this to be only an entertaining science fiction thriller, so I was pleasantly surprised by the level of depth in this story. The author delves heavily into the ethical dilemmas surrounding technology such as cloning and DNA manipulation. Many of these moral issues are already applicable in our present day. It was fascinating to see how these technologies might be utilized and controlled in the future.
This is my first time reading Lafferty, but it certainly won't be my last. In this novel, she demonstrated the ability to write an immersive and engaging story with strong characters and narrative drive. I look forward to reading more from this talented author.
This is a cross-genre novel, which masterfully weaves together the best elements of science fiction, mystery and suspense. This would be an excellent novel to pick up for readers who normally read one of these genres and is interested in expanding their reading. I would recommend this novel to science fiction readers looking for an intelligent and suspenseful story. I would further recommend this book to fellow fans of mysteries and thrillers who are willing to venture out of their comfort zones and experience a futuristic version of a psychological suspense.

Extraordinary. Controversial. Explosive.
Those were the words that I first heard used to describe this debut novel by Ali Land. Many were saying that this book was going to be one of the more controversial novels released in 2017.
I knew I just had to read it. I wanted to know if what they said was true.
It was!
First of all I LOVED the cover of this book. Gold and black with gold raised lettering....Gorgeous!
I was pulled in from the first sentence:
""Forgive me when I tell you it was me""
The book opens as Annie is talking to a detective who can't believe what he's hearing. When she pulls out the stained dungarees so small, the teddy Bear covered with blotches of blood. She tells us that she could have brought more, her mother never knew she kept them. The detective makes a call telling someone to come quickly, his supervisor. He's unsure if she's telling the truth. She repeats her story again and again.
She tells them everything.....
Well almost everything.
They send her home and tell her to act normal, that they're going to come that night. She's terrified they won't come but also terrified that they will...
They do come.
Her mother says nothing as she's dragged from her room. She faces Annie, staring. When no one's looking Annie nods at her mother.
New name. New family.
Shiny.
New.
Me.
After her mother was arrested, Annie (now known as Milly) didn't speak for three days. It appeared she was in shock. But now, she is getting a fresh start. She thinks that she should feel lucky but she's scared. Scared of finding out who she might be and scared of everyone else finding out too.
Her new foster family. Her foster dad, Mike is a psychologist, an expert in trauma. Saskia, her foster-mother just wants to make her feel at home. The Newmonts look like a fantastic family and are they very welcoming.....
Well most of them are. Right away Milly realizes that the daughter, Phoebe does NOT want Milly around.
****Possibly some minor spoilers****
Soon there will be a trial and Milly will have to speak of the horrible things her mother has done. She counts the days until the trial begins. Mike will be working with her both to help her and to help her get ready for testifying.
Milly has ongoing conversations with her mother inside her head which gives us insight into the toxic environment Annie/Milly grew up in. Her mother ""training"" her since an early age.
""Beautiful, pure things make me feel ugly. Tarnished. I remember asking you when I was three, maybe four, where I came from. I waited for you to sweep me up, rub our noses together in an Eskimo kiss and reply, you came for me, you belong with me, I love you. But you didn't respond, you walked out of the kitchen left me standing there alone""
It's not long before Milly starts noticing other things about The Newmonts. She begins to see the cracks in the ""perfect"" family. School becomes another kind of hell for Milly. Mostly due to Phoebe and a few other mean girls. The one saving grace is Miss Kemp. Miss Kemp is a guidance teacher who's very kind and helps Milly get into therapy. Outside of school Milly has one friend, Morgan. Morgan also has secrets. Life is definitely not easy for her either. Thankfully nobody knows Milly's story. They only know the story that is made up. But Milly is terrified that someone will find out and then what? What will they think? What will they do?
The terrorizing at school starts to get worse. But Milly won't tell anyone. I was a bit frustrated with how everyone in Milly's life seemed oblivious to what was happening.
With everything going on, It feels like it's just a matter of time before Milly explodes.
What will happen when Milly has finally had enough?
Wow....This really was quite a book. A chilling read. In my opinion a really well-written psychological thriller. An engrossing, disturbing plot with many well-developed yet flawed characters. There were times that I thought the believability envelope was being pushed a bit far, but I was totally wrapped up in the story and able to overlook most of it.
Honestly, I understand this book may not be for everyone. Some things may be triggering for some people. The subject matter is dark and went a bit deeper than I expected. At the same time I didn't feel like the author overdid it with descriptions of what happened and I appreciated that.
This is a book that will definitely have people talking!
I think this is a very good debut novel and I am already looking forward to reading more from Ali Land.

,"Romance, Contemporary, Contemporary Romance, New Adult",DÃ­sir,"This review is clearly going to go against the grain.
A gruff single-dad, a hot nanny and a cute dream of a little girl? Itâ€™s mostly likely guaranteed to make many female readersâ€™ ovaries explode (!), but right now, I like mine where they are: safe, tucked away and unmoved by this apparently domestic scene. Itâ€™s not so much as that itâ€™s a version of the manwhore/casual player vs the virgin (or at least, the very experienced man vs. the woman who is fairly inexperienced) that chafed my backside because it is, but rather how suddenly a male protagonist can conveniently fall for a woman and suddenly realise he can commit when heâ€™d never given others a chance to do so, while spending most of the book having 3 women sort of tussling over him in a silent territory war.
The truth is, I found it extremely difficult to like the characters at all straight from the start, though Addisonâ€™s insecurity about barely being able to â€˜pleaseâ€™ her own ex might have played into it as well. A single-father by accident, Max had never expected that his neat, Iâ€™m-the-centre-of-my-own-universe to tilt on its axis, first by a baby, then by the nanny that he employs. And thatâ€™s pretty much the story, as both Max and Addison negotiate the bends of their relationship (complete with the dumb-struck, hit-by-lust-moment when they meet) both professionally and personally.
Not only was it hard to accept that Max had difficulty committing to any womanâ€”not least his ex, whom I thought he wronged so badlyâ€”and then suddenly wanting to do do with the nanny when she turned out to be the beautiful, nurturing type that attracted him immediately just smacked of hypocrisy to me. It was only because I think, that heâ€™d never stuck around long enough to do so with any other woman, and that this only happened because they were stuck in close quarters for an extended amount of time. I also couldnâ€™t get past the fact that all he really wanted was to scratch the itch he felt while keeping things casual, yet not being interested in fixing what was broken with his ex.
I didnâ€™t have anything against Addison, but this premise aloneâ€”of Max just going on with life and leaving everything else in the dust, as he did with many other womenâ€”made the entire book difficult to finish. But that Addison herself was insecure about her own femininity made her an easy â€˜targetâ€™ to fall prey to Maxâ€™s propositions to get into another fling. When he finally gotten her where he wanted her, Addison was suddenly the â€˜tighestâ€™, best woman heâ€™d ever been with, the woman he couldnâ€™t remember wanting more, the woman with whom it felt â€˜so rightâ€™.
Unfortunately, â€™The House Mateâ€™ is definitely not the book for me, especially not when everything rubbed me the wrong way and raised every heckle I have. In fact, the vehement reaction I had to this particular book surprised even myself, despite my wanting to give it a fair chance. (less)",Positif

She escapes her captors and ends up in the gothic city of Prague, where she has no clue if the people and supernatural creatures she comes across are friend or foe.

I love this series, it never ever fails to deliver a thrilling story and a smile to my face. Patricia Briggs writes hands down one of the best urban fantasy series ever. I love getting lost in the Tricities realm, the characters feel like friends and family as you read along. This is book ten and the series is still going strong, connecting the previous happenings of the books before while creating a new and unique story.
I was majorly geeking out when reading this book. Why? I studied abroad for a year in the city of Prague, and the majority of this book was based there! And it was all accurate! I felt as if I was walking the streets of that city again and it made me miss it. Briggs very obviously either knows the city well herself, or did some awesome research. Plus the addition of the Prague Golem to the plot? Genius! And amazingly well done.
Anyways, I gave it 4.5 instead of 5 because honestly, Adams bits were kinda boring to me with all the political stuff. But otherwise I LOVED this book. And that twist at the end? I never saw it coming, even though thinking back there were some clues. I just missed them.
This is a series you need to be reading, and if you already are, read this book immediately!

And then...it took me forever to finish it. Unfortunately, much of the book was disappointing. The beginning was slow and mostly involved her family and upbringing. The writing felt juvenile and disjointed, and, sorry to say, boring. It finally picked up when she got to Berkeley and began talking more about food which is what I wanted to hear about in the first place. There was a general timeline but still little vignettes were included that threw that off and felt unnecessary or misplaced or just plain odd. I did learn more about Alice, her passion for food, her inspiration and style, some of the stories were amusing, and it did evoke some lovely memories of Berkeley and remind me of why I enjoy seasonal, farm-fresh, local foods, so all was not lost.

The last month has been nothing but difficult. Trying to balance work, family duties and the expiring deadline of my dissertation is rather stressful and consuming, and I've been constantly exhausted, not only physically, but mentally as well. I can't tell you how many books I started only to put them aside because I couldn't find the energy to continue them. As if my lifeforce, which consists mostly of literature, was drained, and all that was left behind was a shell that talked, ate, slept and smiled. For me, reading has always been a way to escape reality, but also a way to cope with reality. Deprived of my haven and my crutch, I could feel pieces of me chipping away, scattered by reality, and I could do nothing but watch. Why am I telling you all these? Because Emma Chase was the cure. Because her words were the glue to put back together the pieces that make me, well, me. Because she gave me hope, laughter, and love, healed my dreamer's mind that was suffering, and gave me the fairytale I needed so desperately. And I can't thank her enough for that.

So when a producer approaches him, asking him whether he would be interested in participating in a reality show Bachelor-like, with twenty noble women fighting for his affection, he can't help but agree. If he's to go down, why don't go down with a bang?
Sarah Mirabelle Zinnia Von Titebottum is a librarian. A shy girl who is not particularly fond of receiving attention and prefers books to new people. She's waiting for a Colonel Brandon, a reliable, grounded man to love her and be her harbor. But when her sister joins the reality show named Matched and she is forced to babysit her, she comes across the carefree prince and to her surprise she finds a sweet, caring and loyal man, that makes her want something different. Can the shy bookworm tame the reckless prince?
â€œI want to change the world with you at my side, holding your hand. I love you, Sarah, and whatever happens, I promise there wonâ€™t be a day that I donâ€™t love you with all that I am.â€
A dashing romance.
I've read enough books by Emma Chase to know by now that when I want something uplifting, amusing, sexy and swoony, she always delivers. Royally Matched, though, was different. It featured all her trademark elements, but she also added heartwarming. Heartwarming to cause a swelling of tenderness and affection in your chest, sweet and adorable to turn you to warm jelly, and so, so romantic. Of course there were also witty banters, funny dialogues, dirty talking and steamy action beneath the sheets to make you blush, but I think Emma Chase this time focused on the connection that built up between Henry and Sarah and the way it changed them. Henry became calmer, more responsible and dependable, while Sarah started living and fighting her fears that held her back. They complemented each other perfectly, and the last chapters were filled with so many emotions and a tear or two. It was magical.
â€œYou are woven into my soul and you are wrapped around my heart.â€
Royally Matched was woven with the essence of dreams every booklover has secretly wanted to come true at least once or twice in their lives. And for the way it mended my broken wings, it will always hold a special place in my heart.
â€œMy story hasnâ€™t been written yet â€¦ but I know it begins with you.â€

,"Fiction, Science Fiction, Dystopia",Elyse Walters,"Cedar Hawk Songmaker grew up in a liberal home to hippie white parents, Glen and Sera, in Minneapolis. Exceptions were made for Cedarâ€™s adoption â€” bypassing the Indian Child welfare Act. Cedarâ€™s birth mother was Mary Potts, an Ojibwe mother.
Glen and Sera didnâ€™t practice any religion - but when a very pregnant Cedar was 26 years old she turned to Catholicism looking for answers and family connections.
She also was wanted to meet Mary Potts....seeking as much information she could to provide for her unborn child. For an entire year - prior she knew Mary had reached out to her through a letter, but Cedar was too angry at the time, wanting nothing to do with her. But now with a purpose bigger than just herself â€” she was desperate to meet her biological parents.
While 4 months pregnant, Cedar travels north to meet her Ojibwe family....life is becoming more challenging- coming undone: a type of mysterious reverse evolution, political breakdowns, winters without snow, and natural disasters. Glen and Sera, her adoptive parents, tried to warn Cedar about the imminent frightening conditions.
And this was - for me - the first sign of this being a dystopia novel.
â€œEvery service system seems controlled by a separate group. Every city service negotiates with other services. People are forming their own civilian militias, their own rescue posses, hiding pregnant women. Nobody says where of course. The first thing that happens at the end of the world is that we donâ€™t know what is happeningâ€.
As dystopian novels go...this book has enough â€˜relationshipâ€™ scenes with characters to really love - I never felt too far off in â€˜outer limitsâ€™.
And.......if I were pregnant- I sure as hell wouldnâ€™t want the government to get their hands on me. Cedar and her husband Phil didnâ€™t either!
As an â€˜emotionalâ€™ read ... I liked this book .....mostly written as a journal entry from Cedar to her unborn child.
As an intellectual read: creation, God, biological apocalypse: some of it went right over my head.
As for Louise Erdich..... it goes without saying, she is an incredible talent! - Immensely gifted writer!
Thank you Will, ( who stayed with us this summer and we had a blast), his wife, and Harbercollins for the gift of sending me this book with a box of 5 others! Thanks Will... very sweet ... to all of you!

Thomas Houston loved his family, his job, teaching, and writing his novels. What made him kill his entire family on a Saturday night?
No one and especially his â€‹State Trooper friend, DeMarco, can believe he did it, but everything points to Thomas. The missing knife and the missing Thomas himself were strong clues but difficult to believe.
Mr. Silvis keeps you guessingâ€‹ as we follow Thomas as he struggles with this nightmare and as he is running and hiding.
We also follow State Trooper DeMarco as he questions suspects and people who knew Thomas as well as his questioning whether or not Thomas really did kill his entire family.
TWO DAYS GONE has marvelous, descriptive writing that allows you to feel Thomas' physical pain as he is on the run and his emotional pain at the thought of his beautiful family being gone.
Trooper DeMarco's investigation was relentless, oh so good, and impressively described.
Mr. Silvis definitely knows how to tell a terrific story that has extraordinary, believable characters.
This was the first book I read by Mr. Silvis, and I thoroughly enjoyed TWO DAYS GONE.
The book kept spinning and spiraling into better and better as it became more frightening and more tense leaving the reader with an awesome finish.

The characters were annoying and the plot was not there, but at some point in those last 100 pages it suddenly picked up and I was hooked and started to care about imaginary people and their lives. The main character, Mirka, becomes so interesting and the ones you start looking at the story from a new, creepy, almost fairy tale like, perspective everything changes.

,"Fantasy, Mythology, Nonfiction, History, Audiobook",Bookdragon Sean,"The funny thing about Greek mythology is its absolute brutal weirdness. And Stephen Fry totally gets it; he plays on it and as he re-tells it he injects it with so many witty comments. I mean, how could you not? It's waiting to be roasted.
For example, Zeus rips his father Cronos' balls off and throws them to the other side of the earth. The fluid (cough cough) seeps out and thus Aphrodite is born. Once Cronos is defeated, his five children (that he formerly ate) are regurgitated and born anew. They then swear loyalty to Zeus, their liberator from perpetual digestion. On another occasion Zeus has a really bad headache and screams for hours and hours so the other gods decide to bash his head in with a hammer revealing yet another god: Athena. She emerges carrying a spear and is dressed for battle. This material is asking for a man like Stephen Fry.
In a way, the book reminded me of Gaimanâ€™s Norse Mythology. Both books follow the same concept: the reworking of ancient myths to present them to a modern audience without losing any of their originality. And I think itâ€™s a great idea. Stephen Fryâ€™s attempt carries much more of his own personality than Gaimanâ€™s did. (Certainly not a bad thing.) His own voice really shone through and I could tell that he really enjoyed writing this. It may sound strange, but as amused as I was reading it, I know the author was more so penning it.
The stories he presents here are by no means exhaustive, but they are a great introduction to the structure of the Ancient Greek hierarchy amongst the gods. And itâ€™s surprisingly complex with the most powerful not being the one who has taken charge. Zeus is strong, but he would be nothing without his five regurgitated siblings who helped to secure his legitimacy over the Titans who are far older. What I do think the book needs is a contents page or something because I was not entirely sure what I was going into when I picked the book up. Itâ€™s easy to mislead readers, and it would have been good to know what myths and legends are not included.
The part I found most interesting was the Promethean myth. This is a concept Iâ€™m quite fond of, having written on it a few times in academic work, and I did really like the way Fry described his friendship with Zeus before they had their fallout over humanityâ€™s right (or lack thereof) to fire. And it got me thinking, how great would it be to read a novel purely about Prometheus. Madeline Millerâ€™s recent novel Circe gave quite a bit of attention to him, though Iâ€™d love to see him as a protagonist. Hopefully one day someone will write it.
This is a fun book, with many laugh out loud moments that probably capture exactly what you were thinking about the strangeness of some of the myths, Stephen Fry says exactly what he wants too and itâ€™s definitely worth hearing.
p.s- I listened to the audiobook (read by the author) which I think gave it an added edge.

The Man She Knew is a contemporary romance of two high school lovers that were torn apart by one night and one bad decision. Now years later, the feelings of years ago still running high, they are forced to work together on a project. While Maleah receives constant conflict from her family about the no good ex-con Ian Sylvestry, she sees another side to him that everybody seems to love and talk high praises of. For an ex-con, Ian has connections with many influential individuals.
The Man She Knew was a charming and well-written story. There were many twists and turns that formed a believable plot. There was a lot of action and romance to keep my interest piqued. This author really knows how to build up the story and keep your attention to the very end. The characters were well developed and engaging. Loree Lough did a great job of bringing out several feelings throughout this story â€“ heartache, laughter, love, and hope.
This is the first book that I have read by Loree Lough and will certainly not be my last. I was not disappointed at all. I recommend The Man She Knew to anyone that enjoys reading a heartwarming romance that will give you the all the feelings and put a smile on your face.

Three and half stars.
Six characters, all clones, wake up in a spaceship and they discover six corpses (their former clones) that have been murdered...
In other words, the novel is an intrigue about a puzzling multiple murder, but also a great speculation about a society in which cloning is legally (and illegally) possible (not spoilers here, this is seen in the firsts pages).
Precisely, one of the strengths of â€œSix Wakesâ€ is some brilliant ideas about cloning, but also the worldbuilding is good: for example, â€œthe pig-makerâ€ (a big food printer which can create an entire pig).
The characters are well developed and in a plausible way they show how being a clone can transform human psychology. And there is also an AI who is a real nuisance.
The last third of the book is a bit confusing for me, because the plot is so entangledâ€¦ but at the end all is explained and the resolution of the intrigue is correct. (less)",Positif

,"Fiction, Young Adult, Coming Of Age",Lucy Banks,"I received a copy of this book from Netgalley, in return for an honest review.
Teen angst, computer programming and friendship - all set in the glorious 80s...
To be honest, any book that focuses on the 80s is likely to be a bit of a winner for me. If that same book also features Commodore 64s, then it's a match made in heaven.
The book focuses on Will (or Billy to his friends) - a hapless, gangly teen who is on a mission to secure a copy of Playboy. What happens next is a crazy succession of events, involving criminal activity, computer programming, a particular girl called Mary, and plenty of obstacles along the way.
In one way, it's a classic 'coming of age' tale, but to label it as just that would be doing the book a disservice. It's a very warm, authentic book, which captures perfectly the torment of being 14, and the value of good friends. The constant referencing to Commodore 64 programming took me right back to my own misspent youth (all those evenings spent poring over the Commodore 64 magazine, religiously typing lines of code, only to find I'd mucked it all up at the end...) and was such an unusual topic to cover that it felt very fresh.
The ending was also fantastically constructed. I didn't see ANY of it coming, and yet it all felt 100% plausible. Very nicely played, Mr Rekulak!

Katara and Sokka return home only to find everything's changed. It's a battle between maintaining and preserving the past while trying to move forward. The stakes are high when both sides have valid points and loyalties shift and lives threatened.
I highly recommend reading the each series as a whole when each part comes out or waiting for the omnibus editions and maybe space them out because the plot lines may seem formulaic as each member of Team Avatar practically have to tackle a new world after a devastating war and coming to terms with the old and new ways of life.

I really liked the character of Murderbot as it's really quite a grump when it comes to humanity and it's quite cynical about our kind. I enjoyed the inner monologues and pessimistic outlook a lot more than I expected, becuase a snarky but witty robot is always something worth reading about.

Just to be clear: I love pretty much everything about this book. It's fantastically paced, especially for such a long book - I mean, it broke my reading slump. It's hilarious - I laughed out loud multiple times. The romance is adorable and has some of the best development I've read in YA. Monty's character development was 10/10. The holy trinity at the center of the book is a ton of fun. Maybe I'll even talk more about this later and add something to this review. But you know what? You can find a thousand reviews about how cool everything in this book is. I want to talk about why this book was worth reading for me.
There are two things - no, three things - about this book that I think are really special. First of all, Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue is hilarious, but not so light as to be flimsy. Not to shade every other book ever but this is 1) my niche category of favorite book and 2) a balance I think most books fail at; either we get books that are nothing but fluff, or books that are nothing but tragedy. This book is neither. It's dark, but it's also hopeful. When a book feels too light, it's escapist; when it feels too dark, it's depressing. This book made me feel like the universe doesn't suck too much. Just because people are survivors of abuse or trauma doesn't mean we always need to be in a world of angst.
Secondly - I feel like such a pretentious asshole - I love the themes here about not needing to be cured to be an important person. You have no idea how rare it is for chronically ill / disabled / neuroatypical people to be treated as whole, to be treated as real. This book really explores the fact that Percy doesn't want to be cured; he just wants to be treated like a full person. I have never read a book that even mentioned this feeling. It was... perfect. God, I can't put every emotion I felt about this into a full sentence. Just... if you're looking for this theme, please pick this book up.
Third, and maybe most important; this is historical fiction about people who don't get historical fiction. People love to declaim about how the historical fiction genre doesn't need diversity because, apparently, the only people who existed back then were white, straight, and abled. Which is serious bullshit. People like us have always existed; we just don't get books, especially historical fiction. Seeing representation like this in historical fiction is seriously new and it means the fucking WORLD to me.
The great tragic love story of Percy and me is neither great nor truly a love story, and is tragic only for its single-sidedness. It is also not an epic monolith that has plagued me since boyhood, as might be expected. Rather, it is simply the tale of how two people can be important to each other their whole lives, and then, one morning, quite without meaning to, one of them wakes to find that importance has been magnified into a sudden and intense desire to put his tongue in the otherâ€™s mouth.
And yet simultaneously it's so sweet. Like, someone tell me why this book invented romance and being in love.
This is a cute historical romcom focusing on people who don't get historical fiction because the world used to hate us. It's adorable and hilarious and important and I had so much fun reading it.
And this part from the author's note made me cry:
â€” Which begs the question - would a long term relationship between two English men during the eighteenth century have been a real possibility? I don't know. They likely would not have been able to be open about it. But the optimist in me likes to believe that the twenty-first century is not the first time in history that queer people have been able to live full romantic and sexual lives with the people they love.
And if that makes me anachronistic, so be it.
God bless.
And yes, I agree with this.

I value a book when time is taken to grow a relationship that isn't rushed and ON A TUESDAY hit that spot, in fact, it was something of a slow burn which is my favourite kind of burn.
Charlotte was a strong young woman who was perfectly resistant to the charms of footballer Grayson. She had no intention of extending the hand of friendship to Grayson outside of the role of tutor and their early relationship was unintentionally amusing. Grayson slowly began to smash my expectations of his behaviour out of the box and I loved how he began to prove his persistence and tenacity. When things went wrong for these two, they really did go wrong and I felt really angry at Grayson. What happened to the extra mile? There was angst and drama in manageable amounts that evoked all my feelings into the story and characters. I loved the unexpected twists.

This reader is very pleased to say that Heather Hansen develops a world that is quite different than the dystopia books which are made into movies,Hunger Games and Divergent. The plot still involves the oppressed rebelling against the affluent with a running romance throughout.
Hansen masterfully creates a city within this flailing society that consists of Undercity, where the poor and dying eke out an existence until they succumb to a lack of Vitamin D as a result of deficient sunlight. There are several levels above Undercity that are slightly more fortunate before reaching the summit where there is full sun. The privileged few families who control the wealth live here.
With such disparity of wealth and justice, it is essential to restrict the lower level populations to their designated sections. To quell uprisings, the rich and tanned distribute a drug known as Shine to placate the natural anger and frustrations of the seemingly powerless. Thus, the stage is set for the noble male protagonist to meet the savvy female survivor, who just so happens to be second in command of the most agitating resistance group in the city.

But, I do have to say that I enjoyed this thriller. I would give this a 4. To me, this had the slasher film/horror genre feel.
Quincy Carpenter, Lisa Milner, and Samantha Boyd are three women that have all been involved in a brutal massacre. Each women survives the brutal attack and become known as a ""final girl"". These three women have never met but of course know of one another due to all the press and social media following their stories. Then, Lisa the first known ""final girl"" is found dead in her bathtub with her wrists slit and ruled out as a suicide. But, we all know it can't be this easy right?

She was the girl who felt everything, and I was the man who felt nothing at all.
Lo primero que voy a decir es que este libro fue una total sorpresa. Les prometo que el primer 20% estaba rodando los ojos a cada frase. Y cuando supe lo de la hermana, ufff... estuve a punto de dejarlo. Mi descripciÃ³n grÃ¡fica en esos momentos era justo asÃ­...
Pero la autora tiene un estilo que emociona, que atrapa y que te pide que sigas leyendo.
AÃºn en contra de mis convicciones lo hice. Me sorprendiÃ³ como un libro que era tan malo (porque en serio... no lo aguantaba) pudiera recuperarse tanto. Hubo momentos, frases, segundos... que fueron PERFECTOS.
Pero tambiÃ©n hubo algunos que simplemente no deberÃ­an haber estado ahÃ­. Juro por dios que en esos momentos me querÃ­a aventar por la ventana... bueno, al kindle hahaha y casi lo hice eh... pero aguantÃ©.
Graham es un hombre duro, insensible, apÃ¡tico, frÃ­o y calculador.
Lucy es todo lo contrario. Ella cree, ama, llora, vive. SIENTE. Pero siente tanto que a veces es demasiado.
Bien dicen que los polos opuestos se atraen, y estoy convencida que Graham la necesitaba para aprender a sentir y Lucy lo necesitaba para aprender, que no siempre sentir es lo mejor. Que a veces duele demasiado, pero que, de todas formas hay que afrontar las cosas.
Su amor fue pausado, lento. De esos que me gustan. De esos que se van cociendo a fuego lento. De los que se sienten, y son grandes, reales y vibrantes. Simplemente hay amores como esos que no deberÃ­an ser. Pero en el corazÃ³n no se manda. Y si algo he aprendido es que a veces podemos caer por las personas menos indicadas.
For the first time, I began to understand her fully. The beautiful girl who felt everything. Her emotions werenâ€™t what made her weak. They wew her strength
Esto pasa con Graham & Lucy. Son dos personas destinadas a estar juntas pero obligadas a estar separadas.
Hay tantas cosas mal con el libro que no puedo nombrarlas, casi todas son spoiler. Y es por eso que al principio me costÃ³ muchÃ­simo engancharme, me costÃ³ conectar con los personajes y aprender a quererlos.
No me enamorÃ© de Graham como lo hice de Brooks en ""The Silent Waters"" que es, al menos para mÃ­, EL MEJOR LIBRO de esta serie. Graham no estÃ¡ al nivel de Tristan tampoco, pero para mÃ­, lleva un muy merecido tercer puesto en esta serie.
ATENCIÃ“N: TE AMO Brooks, todo mi corazÃ³n, para ti FOREVER...
Ok no, me fui... sigo con esta reseÃ±a!!!
Lo que pasa es que Ã©l, Graham no Brooks â¤ eh, en un principio fue demasiado patÃ¡n, demasiado frio, y desapegado. DEMASIADO ARROGANTE. Su pasado no me resultÃ³ tan impactante. Al menos, no para que justificara el ser como es.
Â¿Me sorprendiÃ³ su evoluciÃ³n?
SI. Totalmente. Fue de no sentir nada, a tener el corazÃ³n desbordando de sentimientos. Pero hasta ahÃ­.
Todo lo contrario me pasÃ³ con Lucy, me parece que fue por mucho la mejor protagonista de la autora. Es encantadora, es fuerte y es simplemente la clase de persona que me gustarÃ­a ser. Una guerrera con los pies sobre la tierra, pero al mismo tiempo una soÃ±adora irremediable.
Me encantÃ³ el profesor, amÃ© a Talon y odiÃ© con todas mis fuerzas a Jane y Parker. QuizÃ¡s ese es el mayor logro de la autora, meter a algunos personajes en tu corazÃ³n y hacer que no puedas soportar a otros. Gracias Brittainy por darme sensaciones que no pensÃ© sentir, por mostrarme que todos podemos encontrar a nuestro Graham o nuestra Lucille.
â€œBeing around you does something strange to me, something that hasnâ€™t happened in such a long time.â€
""What happens?â€
He took my hand in his then led it to his chest, and his next words came out as a whisper. â€œMy heart begins to beat again.â€
Un amor asÃ­, es imposible de olvidar. Pero siento que en su historia hubo muchas cosas mal tambiÃ©n.
En fin, si lo que buscas es un amor bonito, pausado e inolvidable este es tu libro. Creo que mis valores y convicciones me impidieron disfrutar de Ã©l, tanto como querÃ­a. ES QUE EN SERIO... ESO NO SE HACE...
NO
NUNCA
JAMÃS
NADITA
NANAIS
NEVER
En conclusiÃ³n, no es el mejor de la serie pero si es uno de los que mejores momentos tuvo. Los mÃ¡s emotivos y emocionales fueron con el profesor. Se llevÃ³ mi corazÃ³n. Estoy 100% segura que si no eres como yo, lo vas a AMAR.

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction, Medieval, European Literature, British Literature",Rachel Hall,"The Last Hours served as both my introduction to the writing of Minette Walters and to the genre of historical fiction. As a reader of crime thrillers I was drawn by virtue of the authors reputation and that the novel is essentially a character driven examination of the new beginnings that the Black Death heralded for many. The pestilence did much more than simply claim the lives of swathes of men; it also created a series of religious, social and economic upheavals. None was more important than that of bringing down the prevailing social hierarchy, handing bondsmen their freedom and putting a manâ€™s destiny in his own hands. Indifferent to class distinctions, taking whomever it chose, the Black Death put lords on equal footing with serfs and along with peril came opportunity. This comprehensively researched novel adheres to the widely known facts of the pandemic but Minette Walters vividly brings the story to life by examining the profound effects on the lives of the inhabitants of Develish, Dorseteshire.
When the Black Death entered England through the port of Melcombe, Dorseteshire in June 1348 little was known about the sickness or how it would transform the landscape. The third day of July, 1348 sees the imperious Sir Richard of Develish preparing to leave his demesne and travel to Bradmayne in the hope of securing a marriage for his petulant fourteen-year-old daughter, Lady Eleanor. Rumour has reached Develish that potential suitor, Lord Peter, has succumbed to the return of a childhood illness and with a dowry in tow, Sir Richard and his retinue depart. With no love lost for Sir Richard from either the two-hundred serfs tied to his fealty or from his intelligent and humane wife, Lady Anne, Develish exhales a collective sigh of relief as he leaves. More worthy than her husband in every sense, Lady Anne sees no distinction between serfs and lords and after being educated by nuns from the age of six she is both literate and conversant with the benefits of sanitation, treating and isolating the sick. Since her arrival at Develish as a fourteen-year-old girl she has steadily assumed the running of the demesne, all without the egotistical or lustful Sir Richard any the wiser. However, the altogether clearer sighted bondsmen are well aware and have been the direct beneficiaries of her efforts. Within Sir Richardâ€™s retinue his wife has embedded her friend and ally, Gyles Startout, an elevated serf and a devoted man who is her eyes and ears on travels with her feckless husband.
When Sir Richard returns early from his travels with news that Lord Peter is gripped by the pestilence, he himself is already ailing and to his fury Lady Anne makes the decision to exile him outside of the moat surrounding Develish. Whilst popular misconception and the uneducated see the sickness as a punishment for sins, readily subscribed to by dissolute priest Father Anselm, Lady Anne remains coolly sceptical. She is something of a heretic, who sees survival not through beseeching God but through isolating the sick, pooling resources and working together. Accepting the wrath of her spiteful daughter and with Sir Richard dead within days, the bondsmen of Develish readily look to Lady Anne who unites the demesne and abolishes the prevailing social order. Stepping up to the role of steward is base-born Thaddeus Thurkell, a swarthy looking giant pilloried by stepfather, Will, and inciting the fury of the poisonous Lady Eleanor for the scant attention he pays her. Short on words, his education and imposing physicality make him a natural choice for steward but few appreciate it at the time as Sir Richardâ€™s steward, the meddling Master Hugh de Courtesmain is relieved of his position.
As the months pass and food stores run low the enforced claustrophobia of Develish gives rise to petty gripes, infighting, boredom and madness in the case of Lady Eleanor. Frustrated by the lack of knowledge of the world outside Develish, it is Thaddeus Thurkell who sacrifices himself for Develish and Lady Anne and leads a ragtag group on a mission through the disseminated villages outside the demesne to secure provisions and bring news. What follows is an immersive account of the treacherous recce undertaken by Thaddeus weaved alongside the continuation of life in Develish. Darkly atmospheric, The Last Hours is infused with a sense of menace as tensions threaten to spoil over and fear runs rife at the future that lies ahead. Not only is Develish vividly drawn, but the ravaged villages beyond as Thaddeus and his gang are met by fetid corpses and rat infestations and in addition have their eyes opened to the potential for a future freed from and outside of the demesne of Develish.
â€œTo Black Death promised freedom to anyone who survived it. With so many dead, serfs skilled in farming would be prized once lords became desperate to have their fields ploughed and planted: and their need would give men and women the chance to bargain themselves out of bondage and demand payment for their work.... From being the most despised of people, peasants would become the most valued, for without their labour no Lord would be able to keep and govern his demesne.â€
The Last Hours is a searing testimony to the courageous triumvirate (Lady Anne, Thaddeus Thurkell and Gyles Startout) who dedicate themselves unflaggingly to keeping the scourge outside of their confines. As the threesome go to increasing lengths to ensure the fragile accord holds Minette Walters gives life to a memorable cast, from churlish Lady Eleanor, shrewd Thaddeus who leads by example, the self-sacrificing Gyles Startout to the quiet sensibility and sharp wit of Lady Anne. Genuinely gripping this sprawling tale takes its readers to the beating heart of the community of Develish, and Walters draws many of the leading serfs and their families (Trueblood, Startout, Buckler, Catchpole) into the narrative, making the reader privy to every part of the drama. Full of intrigue The Last Hours succeeds in evoking one of the most perilous period in medieval history. With some of Lady Anneâ€™s principal relationships given greater emphasis (Lady Eleanor and Thaddeus Thurkell), Walters succeeds in putting her character under the microscope and my admiration for a heroine, saviour and true leader of people goes unparalleled.
Whilst Minette Walters could have opted for the altogether more people pleasing introduction of a romantic element into the denouement, she instead leaves her story rather open-ended for the monumentally more ambitious continuation of this saga and I shall be alongside the fellows of Develish every step of the way. An education in itself, I doubt I would have been so thoroughly held in thrall by a sterile recounting of the Black Death, but The Last Hours captures the very essence of the period in a fist pumping and expansive character led story of resilience and fortitude.

,"Childrens, Middle Grade, Fantasy, Fiction, Animals",Michelle,"With Red, Katherine Applegate introduces another quiet, resilient protagonist who -- like the caged gorilla in â€œThe One and Only Ivan,â€ -- speaks movingly to a noisy, belligerent world. Red is a caring oak who describes her life as a leafy shelter for generations of animals, and as a wishtree for humans. Itâ€™s easy to suspend disbelief with her wise voice, active mind and caring soul. She knows well the habits of creatures in her world and treats readers to an insightful analysis -- though the habits of humans could be a bit trickier for her.
â€œTwo hundred and sixteen rings, and I still havenâ€™t figured them out.â€
The pacing starts out slowly, with early chapters focused almost entirely on the natural world, but eventually we get to meet the human at the novelâ€™s center. Samar, a recent Muslim refugee, is lonely and in need of a friend. When a teenager carves a hateful message into Redâ€™s trunk, she worries about its effect on Samar and her family. Amidst all this, the woman who owns the property threatens to cut down Red, having forgotten the story of her ancestors and the beginning of all the wishes. As much as she doesn't want to be chopped down, Red still persists to help Samar. So she and her best buddy, a crow named Bongo, begin to scheme about helping Samar make a connection to the community, with poignant results.
Applegate often untangles thorny subjects for young readers. In ""Wishtree"", she takes on anti-Muslim bigotry, handling the subject with a light touch, so the treatment doesn't feel heavy. There's sly humor, and fun friendships involving the tree, talking animals, and humans, mixed in with some meaty scientific information about trees and animals. The story is sprinkled with strikingly beautiful language, but never showy. My favorite was, ""the stars freckled the sky.""
I adored Red! And her story could teach us a lot about kindness, friendship, family, heritage, and so much more.

on a different note, i didnt think this was as good as the first book (only in the slightest). i still enjoyed it, but it felt a bit more dense than necessary. i definitely think this could have been shortened without compromising the story, but i didnt mind too much because of VSs writing. as with the first book, the writing was the highlight for me. malchai uprising? meh. new monster on the loose? its whatever. but schwabs ability to convey augusts internal conflict in a tragic, yet beautiful, way? absolutely brilliant!
also, can i mention how impressed i was with that ending?! i respect VS so much for writing it. that doesnt mean it didnt hurt me any less, but wow, im impressed (if you know, you know).

Say Iâ€™m Yours is an emotional, remarkable, and beautifully written second chance romance. These Hennington brothers sure do bring the feels. And that is exactly why these books are perfect for a reader like me. I love nothing more than to FEEL when I read. And Corinne always brings the feels.
Trent Hennington is the oldest of the Hennington brothers. Heâ€™s the town sheriff and although heâ€™s only loved one woman in his life, heâ€™s never committed to her. And now heâ€™s lost her.
Sheâ€™s the girl I love. The girl Iâ€™ve always loved but was too stupid to hold on to. That wonâ€™t happen again.
Grace loves Trent Hennington more than anything. But sheâ€™s tired of constantly feeling not good enough. Sheâ€™s in her mid-late thirties. Sheâ€™s not young anymore. She wants to be with someone who will settle down with her, marry her, have children with her. She wants it all. And Trent has proven over and over again he's not the man to give it to her.
It puts Grace in a hard place. Trent is the only man she wants, heâ€™s her true love. But itâ€™s been twenty years. How long can one woman wait? So she does her best and tries to move on. Being single in a small town isnâ€™t easy, but her best friends brother, Cooper Townsend has always been there. He likes Grace and asks her out. So why not? Sheâ€™s got to put herself out there and at least try.
Cooper is Presleyâ€™s brother and a true gentleman and sweetheart. You canâ€™t help but to love him. Of course when Trent hears Grace is going on a date with him, he doesnâ€™t make it easy. Grace must decide if Trent is worth fighting for and truly taking a chance on again, or if she should go the safe path with someone like Coopâ€¦
Oh my Trent. My heart broke for this man. He was one of those guys who didnâ€™t know what he had till it was gone, but once it was, he fought like heck to keep her. I truly felt for him and why he was the way he was and felt the way he did. Grace was great as well. Things got a little angsty between them and with the whole Cooper thing, and it could have been plain messy, but it wasnâ€™t. Grace was a class act.
I love this whole crew and the small town feel these books have. Even though all of the Hennington brothers have their own books, I hope there are more books in this series. Say Iâ€™m Yours is a stunning and heartfelt second chance romance. Itâ€™s a book that made me feel, made me smile and made my heart soar. I loved it so much and give it a full 5 stars!
â€œSay Iâ€™m yours,â€ he demands.

This book read like the Narnia series for adults. I appreciate the tackling of difficult and real themes but wish they were more fleshed out and more time was taken on each topic. Would've even been okay with less themes explored but explored thoroughly. Like the Narnia books, this novel jumped around from scene to scene and I felt like I couldn't really get super invested.

TIN MAN is a complex story of tough love and friendships, dysfunctional families and heartbreaking loss....losses that disrupt life that are mostly, but not always associated with death....And it all begins so innocently with a raffle for a painting of sunflowers.
Ellis and Michael are so young when they first meet and discover some of the possibilities of life; and when Annie joins the picture, the two become three and even deeper friendship's evolve.
So much....yet so little life is lived in this relatively short, emotionally charged story, yet amidst the silence of repressed grief, there are also laughs, fun times and unforgettable kindnesses.
While initially confused with some of the abrupt shifts in timeline, the TIN MAN, my first Sarah Winman novel turned out to be one fine read!

I thoroughly enjoyed this story from start to finish and it was a book that was extremely hard to put down!

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Romance, Fiction, Mystery, Adult, Writing, Books About Books",Lisa Ahlstedt,"This was an interesting book in that it combined two different stories: that of sisters Lilly and Neave as post WWII businesswomen, and a romance featuring plucky but powerless Electra Gates who throws her lot in with pirates rather than marry a despicable man (as you do). In the modern story, Lilly is the more flighty of the two sisters. She's attractive and sociable but doesn't seem to take life too seriously. Neave, in contrast, is more of an introvert, happier in the world of books than in the real world. Born in the mid 1920s, they live in Massachusetts with their parents and two siblings. As a young girl, Neave is given a job of reading aloud to an elderly neighbor who has vision problems. This begins her love of books. When she browses the bookshelves on a reading break, her eye is caught by a romance novel titled ""The Pirate Lover."" She sneaks the book out and hides it in a closet at home. From then on, she retreats to this secret world to read other books she ""borrows"" from her neighbor, but she always returns to the pirate story.
After they graduate from high school, the sisters work in various jobs until the end of the war means that the jobs are reserved for returning soldiers. Because Lilly had been so successful at her job at a cosmetics counter, the two sisters decide to start their own cosmetics company, Be Your Best Cosmetics. It's apparently a sort of Mary Kay operation, except everything is baby blue instead of pink. Anyway, naturally, the company becomes very successful, mainly due to the personal attention and encouragement the company's salesladies offer their customers. Eventually, they hire a chemist who also helps improve the quality of their products.
The chapters alternate being narrated by Lilly, who we learn from the first sentence is now dead; a biographical story about the sisters and their company; and excerpts from the pirate story. Lilly is joined in the afterlife by the family's former dog, Mr. Boppit, who seems to have a human body now since he wears a Navy uniform and high heels (still not sure why). Anyway, it soon transpires that Lilly married an abusive man who presumably is responsible for her current state, and he still has it in for Neave. So Lilly and Mr. Bobbit are observing the situation and trying to keep Neave safe.
The pirate story involves a poor girl whose mother is trying desperately to marry her off to a rich husband. Of course, the one who is interested makes no secret of the fact that he is cruel and deviant. Electra flees to the ship of his brother, who is a pirate, but apparently much nicer to the ladies. Of course, rich brother doesn't take too kindly to this, so there is a lot of fighting on the high seas (along with a bunch of presumably nautical terms that only serve to confuse the matter). Why this story so enchanted Neave is a mystery in itself.
The story was interesting in the way that it kept shifting points of view. Again, I don't understand why the dog was wearing high heels or so interested in fashion, but hey, it was different. It was also something of a mystery why Lilly was so self-destructive. Overall it was an interesting story, even if I didn't really connect the pirate and cosmetic dots. There is an afterward where the author says she was interested in the ""struggle to dominate and be subordinated"" so presumably that was the focal point of the novel.

This book stars Suzanne â€˜Zaneâ€™ Jaffe who is thirty-five, works in real estate, is a lesbian, and â€“ throughout the course of this series â€“ more exactly for the past 12/13 months, she has been attempting to become pregnant through artificial means. While that has been going on, around month 3 or 5, Zane started â€˜datingâ€™ another woman named Dred (Mildred) who has a kid of her own (baby James). Pretend dating â€“ to get her friends, mostly Jaq, to stop talking about Zane hooking up with someone. Or, at least it was supposed to be pretend dating.
And so â€“ thatâ€™s what this book is about. Zane, who has appeared in the previous five books as a side character, is now front and center and having a point of view of her own (the only point of view in the book). Trying to get pregnant. While that other plot line that has bounced along in the series, that serial killer guy . . . (view spoiler). So plot lines â€“ Zane 1) is trying to get pregnant; 2) is planning a party at Club Fredâ€™s; 3) is pretend dating Dred; 4) is working through the concept of trying to become pregnant for the past year; 5) is working through the concept that maybe she doesnâ€™t want to just be â€˜pretendingâ€™ with Dred.
Meanwhile . . . I havenâ€™t actually said much that wasnâ€™t in the book description.
Everyone that has appeared in the series, at least the main characters, show up in this end-book. Emerson and Obie from book one play prominent roles â€“ they kind of have to since they live in the same house that Dred lives in (with Baby James) â€“ thereâ€™s a story there, apparently â€˜Aunt Florenceâ€™ mostly raised Obie and Dred (so those two grew up together). Jaq and Hannah from book two â€“ more Jaq, also play important roles, since Jaq, Zane, and Carlos (who doesnâ€™t get a book of his own) â€˜grew up togetherâ€™ (not exactly sure what that means fully, though I know they went to school together, though Carlos is somewhere around being at least three months older than the other two â€“ as a â€˜hintâ€™ â€“ Carlos is the one who self proclaims himself to be a â€˜dwarfâ€™). Ed and Alisha, from book 3, have less of an â€˜inâ€™ into this story group, but are known by Zane and so appear here in the book. Iâ€™m not sure what Zaneâ€™s connection, exactly, is with Keith/Cam/and Josh (those three being the mains of book 4), but they play a large role in this book since Zane keeps bouncing over to their community center for â€˜reasonsâ€™ â€“ some of which correspond to Zaneâ€™s need to throw a party.
Before I go too far - it should be noted: This book really is one that is better read after the other books in the series. Thereâ€™s a ton of information to already know â€“ some of which is revealed/rementioned in the book, but . . . to a lesser extent than might have occurred if the other books in the series hadnâ€™t existed. Just a warning. Mind you, I did only complete books two and three, and still came to the conclusion that I did regarding book five (this book here) â€“ a conclusion to be mentioned later.
Of less importance, and more of just something I noted along the way - I've known about this book, and its cover, from the beginning - since I started reading the first word in this series (or, at the very least, around the same time I read book two â€“ The Butch and the Beautiful). So I've pictured Zane as the woman on the cover of this book whenever she popped up in the series. Well, it appears that - yes she has purple hair; she also has some portion of her head 'shaved' - unless I misread 'my half-shaved purple' - unlike the woman on the cover of the book.
Right, so, the story itself â€“ I was bouncing along nicely with the story, watching it unfold â€“ Zaneâ€™s all angsty about getting pregnant, and feeling like maybe she shouldnâ€™t have suggested that â€˜pretendâ€™ dating idea to Dred, because now she wants to actually date her; while also throwing together plans to hold a party â€“ maybe at Club Freds. You know, the plot was unfolding. Then the main character started doing a few stupid things â€“ things that she knew were stupid, took the time to think about them, and then did them anyway. And . . . it annoyed me. That was around 62% into the book. You know what happened after that? The unexpected. I spent a good portion of the last 38% of the book giggling and outright laughing and or being happy with the book (there's a hilarious scene wherein Zane is 'impregnating' herself, while Dred watches. . . and 'helps'; I knew that scene was going to occur because there were 'mentions' before it happened - frankly I kind of expected to be grossed out, instead I found it hilarious). Odd, that. *shrugs*
But what Iâ€™ve already noted is what the book is about â€“ an end book the series, â€˜stuffâ€™ has occurred, the â€˜cameraâ€™ has focused on certain characters in this La Vista place in California â€“ zeroing in on a few queers here and there â€“ starting with the gay guy with MS (specifically mentioning Emerson, since this is a one camera â€˜comedyâ€™ type situation, as in one point of view â€“ more later), then the â€˜stereotypicalâ€™ Butch-Femme match-up of book 2 (of which, the couple joked in this book here, book 5, that theyâ€™d be the ones to talk to the old guard queers, because of their Butch-Femme situation), then both a transgender story and a twist on the idea of what it means to be queer â€“ with the third book focusing on a MF couple (one of whom is transgender (and â€˜ethnicâ€™), other one thought of themselves as being a lesbian before joining up with this man). Fourth book pulled in a â€˜polyâ€™ gay relationship.
So, what did book five pull in? At the outset it pulled in a woman who was willing to pretend to date another woman to â€˜hold offâ€™ on pressure from friends to â€˜find someoneâ€™ to â€˜helpâ€™ with this pregnancy hunt (more help hold hand, and the like, not help as in impregnate). Said woman, Zane, never planned to end up in an actual real relationship â€“ itâ€™s not in her plans, not on her list. No, she wants to get pregnant. And have a family that way. Sheâ€™s not aromantic, or asexual though, no sheâ€™s a lesbian with a strong need to have a certain freedom that comes from being able to come home to your place, and bounce around naked â€“ because no one else is there. Her â€˜pretendâ€™ girlfriend is a self-described pansexual woman, who has a kid of her own, and is and/or gives the impression of being chubby. That being Dred, who is also, as noted somewhere above, connected to an older woman named Aunt Florance who raised her and Obie (the story behind that might have been mentioned at some point, but if so, I missed it). Dred, or Mildred, is the individual who allows me to put the book on my â€˜person of colorâ€™ shelf, being as sheâ€™s half-white/half-black.
Dredâ€™s actual occupation is not one that I was able to pin down. As far as I could figure out, Dred has varying income â€“ as in one month she might pull in 200 dollars, another month could see 500 or more; and somehow or another that income comes from photographing people getting married. I believe sheâ€™s a photographer who owns her own company. I could be wrong about that. Itâ€™s not easy to tell completely, since everything about her comes through Zaneâ€™s eyes since Dred doesnâ€™t have a point of view of her own.
One interesting aspect of bouncing around among a group of people who know of each other â€“ some closely, some more of a passing acquaintance, is the neat part of watching the POV pull in some side characters â€“ and see them slightly differently than others have in the past (like Donald that old Asian dude who is a legend; or Fredi; or any of the main characters seen through someone elseâ€™s eyes).
Overall I enjoyed the book â€“ it wasnâ€™t as angsty as I thought it might end up being, though there were moments wherein I thought it might end up being. Donâ€™t get me wrong, thereâ€™s a bunch of angst involved â€“ about pregnancy, relationships, etc. Just . . . not an overwhelming amount.
I liked both main characters, and the individuals who they bumped into, though a reader really gets to know Zane more than anyone else. One of those unfortunate aspects of a one person point of view. Still, I got to know Dred and Zane well enough to like them together.

,"Fiction, Contemporary, Literary Fiction, European Literature, British Literature, Novels",Gumble's Yard,"This isnâ€™t a ghost story, though itâ€™s the dead of winter when it happens, a bright sunny post-millennial global-warming Christmas (Christmas, too, dead) and itâ€™s about real things really happening in the real world involving real people in real time on the real earth (uh huh, earth, also dead)
And hereâ€™s another version of what was happening that morning, as if from a novel in which Sophia is the kind of character sheâ€™d choose to be, prefer to be, a character in a much more classic sort of story, perfectly honed and comforting, about how sombre yet bright the major-symphony of winter is and how beautiful everything looks under a high frost, how every glass blade is enhanced and silvered into individual beauty â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ a story in which there is no room for severed heads â€¦. In which Sophiaâ€™s perfectly honed minor-symphony modesty and narrative decorum complement the story sheâ€™s in with the right kind of quiet wisdom-from-experience ageing-female status, making it a story thatâ€™s thoughtful, dignified, conventional in structure â€¦. The kind of quality literary fiction where the slow drift of snow across the landscape is merciful â€¦.
The second in Ali Smithâ€™s seasonal quartet, which started with the Booker shortlisted Autumn.
The basic plot is an unusual family Christmas reunion â€“ Art goes to visit his mother Sophia: a once successful business woman who ran businesses selling third world craft items and then artificially distressed furnishings, with her business now failed she still has her huge Cornish mansion â€“ one which she first visited when it was occupied by a commune including her now estranged older sister Iris, a long time social activist and rebel. Art, an insincere nature blogger, has just broken up with his environmentally active girlfriend Charlotte â€“ and pays a Croatian girl Lux he meets at a bus stop to impersonate Charlotte for the weekend. She invites Iris to join them.
Sophia opens the book by looking at a postcard of Eduoard Boubat's ""La Petite Fille Aux Feullies Mortes"" - the same postcard that Daniel Gluck in ""Autumn"" sent to a younger lady called ""Sophie something"" on a visit to Paris. Daniel himself is not named in ""Winter"" but a comparison of incident's described in the two books from Daniel and Sophia's viewpoints respectively, make it clear that Daniel is in fact Art's father.
https://www.artsy.net/artwork/edouard...
However more so than the overlap of characters, â€œWinterâ€ shares many similarities in style and approach, with its predecessor and it is clear that Smith is treating this quartet (at least on the evidence of its first two elements) as a single body of artistic work.
Similarities I observed between the two books
- An rhythmical opening chapter, clearly designed to be read aloud, with her the â€œAll across the country â€¦ â€œ of Autumn replaced with â€œ â€¦.. is deadâ€ of Winter
- The extensive use of wordplay and punning â€“ and a character who delights in this and expanding other characterâ€™s appreciation of language, ironically (but presumably very deliberately given the immigration and Brexit ideas running through both books) in both cases a non-native English speaker. In Autumn, Daniel broadens the language of the young Elisabeth, in Winter Lux has a great grasp of English language and literature and her own name serves as a pun at one stage Lux/Lexiography.
- A deliberate coverage of immediately contemporary events woven through the text (here â€“ Grenfell Tower, Nicholas Soames â€œwoofingâ€ at a female labour MP in the commons, Theresa Mayâ€™s â€œcitizen of the worldâ€ speech, the crowdfunding by the far-right of a ship to block immigrant rescues)
- A concentration on one overarching contemporary theme â€“ with Trump being the Winter equivalent of Autumnâ€™s Brexit vote
- A distinct left-of-centre liberal bias to the political commentary, one which (in my view unfortunately in the days of social media echo-chambers) is only likely to reinforce rather than challenge the world view of Smithâ€™s readers. You will look in vain for any criticism of Labour politicians for example.
- A link between past political actions and the politics of today â€“ part of the concept of seasonality that Smith set out to explore when she commenced the quartet â€“ the concept that our real energy, our real history, is cyclic in continuance and at core, rather than consecutive and how closely to contemporaneousness a finished book might be able to be in the world, and yet how it could also be, all through, very much about stratified, cyclic time
In Autumn very deliberate parallels are drawn between the Profumo scandal and the Brexit vote â€“ the concept of the lies of those in power.
In Winter, the environmental and climate-change activism of Charlotte (Artâ€™s ex-girlfriend) and the refugee involvement of the modern day Iris are linked directly to the Silent-Spring inspired environmental activism of the commune where Iris lives many years before and her role in the Greenham Common protests.
Interestingly the message here is much more positive than Autumn, that the abuses of those in power can overtime be overcome by yearâ€™s of protest and activism.
Smithâ€™s concept of cyclic time (and also perhaps the reason for the more positive take on events in this season) are bought together when Sophia is listening to Christmas music which â€¦ intrinsically means a revisiting. It means the rhythm of the passing of time, yes, but also, and more so, the return of time in its endless and comforting cycle to this special point in the year when regardless of the dark and the cold we shore up and offer hospitality and goodwill and give them out, a bit of luxury in a world primed against them both
- A cover featuring trees and with trees appearing as an image throughout the book. This is no coincidence, as in an interview on the significance of trees for the quartet Smith says
Trees are great. Don't get me started about how clever they are, how oxygen-generous, how time-formed in inner cyclic circles, how they provide homes for myriad creatures, how back when this country was covered in forests the word for sky was an old English word that meant tops of trees ... The sweetness they create. The things they help us create. The pollination they make possible, their utter (mellow) fruitfulness. Their gestural uprightness plus bendiness, their suppleness in all weathers. Their shelter. Their ingenuity with colours, and with looking after themselves seasonally. Their organic relation to books.
In Winter - the significance of trees is bound up with the importance of colour. Smith emphasises here that green (more specifically evergreen) is as much the colour of winter as white and also that green is an ancient colour (of moss and first) which pre-dates the other colours of nature.
Again I feel that this is a nod to the more optimistic parts of the season that this book is starting to
explore. I could not help seeing a link between the evergreen trees which maintain their colour through the winter months and the clear link Smith draws between the 70s Environmental protests, the Greenham common protests and the pro-immigrant and anti-climate change activism of the present day.
- A concentration on a certain decade: 1960s for Autumn, 1980s for Winter (although perhaps less coherently than in Autumn given that Hepworth died in the 1970s so that the 1980s actions is around people visiting her studio rather than Hepworth's own life in that time). I understand Spring will be 1920s based and Summer 1940s based.
- The firm SA4A (Smith, Ali, Quartet, Autumn) serving as a symbol for the threat of faceless and almost unknown multinationals. In Autumn, we see SA4A as a quasi-police private security firm, here Art works for their entertainments division to enforce copyright on emerging artists
- The symbolism of fences and commons â€“ in Autumn Elisabethâ€™s mother is shocked by a fence erected on a common near her home (the fence serving a metaphor for Brexit), in Winter Iris chains herself to a fence at the very start of the Greenham Commons protests. I understand that for Smith one of the key stories in the book is the tale of the initial Greenham common protestors visiting a hardware store to buy chains and padlocks ........ and this set off for her the image of a chain reaction ... and her view that this initial small actions lead ultimately to nuclear disarmament.
- A lady struggling with high-street bureaucracy â€“ here Autumnâ€™s passport service of the Post Office is substituted by the financial advisers of high-street banks
- A relatively unknown and now female artist â€“ here the sculptor Barbara Hepworth (in Autumn the pop-artist Pauline Boty). Both artists died tragically (Boty of cancer Hepworth of a fire in her studio) and both could be said to be (unfairly) overshadowed by men working in the same field and broad style (Warhol and Henry Moore respectively) â€“ with Smith looking to deservedly restore their reputation.
As an aside I have to confess that for four years I attended a Cambridge college whose centrepiece was one of Hepworth's sculptures - Four Square (Walk Through) but that for years I falsely attributed the sculpture to Henry Moore (who also had a strong link to the college and was an honorary fellow)
https://barbarahepworth.org.uk/sculpt...
Finally it is fascinating to note that Barbara Hepworth was herself a founder member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.
- A male character with a past link to that artist and who collected that art. Daniel with Pauline Boty here substituted by Artâ€™s real fatherâ€™s love of Barbara Hepworth: a pilgrimage to Cornwall to see the studio in which she lived and died, leads to him meeting Artâ€™s mother
- Actual works of art of the artist figuring in the book and sparking a characterâ€™s imagination â€“ in the same way Elisabeth looks at a book of Botyâ€™s paintings, Artâ€™s mother views a Hepworth sculpture (I believe â€œNesting Stonesâ€) owned by his father â€“ more crucially she takes one of the two stones and brings it out from its hiding place in the present time
As an aside the concept of two nesting heads is a recurring one through the novel - Art as a child with Sophie, Lux with Art, Iris and Sophie as children and then later as adults
- The characterâ€™s reaction to the art serving as a very deliberate metaphor for what Smith is trying to do in her quartet.
In Autumn, Elisabeth comments on one of Botyâ€™s paintings The cow parsley. The painted flowers. Botyâ€™s sheer unadulterated reds in the re-image-ing of the image. Put it together and what have you got? Anything useful? which echoes a question Smith asked of herself in an interview as she started work on the concept We'll see what happens. I have no idea how the reality will meet the conception. I'm looking forward to finding out
In Winter, Sophia comments of the Hepworth sculpture It makes you walk around it, it makes you look through it from different sides, see different things from different positions. Itâ€™s also like seeing inside and outside something at once which is a perfect metaphor for how Smith's writing forces us to examine our world
- References to classic literature, including by Shakespeare and Dickens; in Autumn The Tempest and A Tale of Two Cities, here Cymbeline and A Christmas Carol.
- Set alongside the high-brow cultural references, the influence of TV light entertainment - in Autumn we had the game show and minor celebrity participant and clear Harry Hill influences; here Artâ€™s step-father was a sitcom star and at times Smith explicitly references an imaginary sitcom studio audience reacting to the action of the book
- The mixing of the real and the imaginary and the mixing of time periods.
In Autumn much of the book is set in dreams, imagination or memory, and at times we are unclear even whose memory we are in or even how real the memories are â€“for example much of the dialogue between the young Elisabeth and Daniel may in fact be Daniel merging memories of his sisterâ€™s precocious wordplay.
In Winter there are numerous memories and flashbacks - but the real imaginary aspect is provided by two floating elements seen only by one character. Sophia has a floater which then turns into a childâ€™s head, metamorphoses through an old man and a green man and then seems to ultimately transform into the stone that she has kept from Hepworthâ€™s â€œNesting Stonesâ€. The disembodied head seems to have come to Smith as the concept of society â€œlosing its headâ€ I voting for Brexit, but I also thought the concept of a head acting alone from is body could apply to Trump.
More mysteriously Art sees a floating piece of coastline â€“ possibly inspired by his sub-conscious guilt over a continual dream Charlotte had (and which was ignored by him) of quartering herself as a symbol for the possible break-up of Britain, possibly by her warning about the piece of coastline the size of Wales, imminently to break off the Antarctic shelf and possibly a nod to the inspiration Hepworth took herself from the North Yorkshire coastline of the family holidays of her childhood and which she later sought in the Cornish coast
- The concept of time-containers. When discussing the quartet, Smith commented But we're time-containers, we hold all our diachrony, our pasts and our futures (and also the pasts and futures of all the people who made us and who in turn we'll help to make) in every one of our consecutive moments / minutes / days / years
In Autumn this concept was captured particularly in Danielâ€™s dreams and his memories of his fleeing from Nazi Germany and of his brilliant sister killed in the holocaust.
In Winter the concept is even more explicit. When discussing Artâ€™s visions of the floating coastline, Lux explains what she calls her own coastline.
One of my motherâ€™s uncles was doing the family three thing when I was about ten and he showed me my place on the map of people heâ€™s made, I was down at the bottom, I looked at the names above mine, going back in time, all the centuries that the names meant and I thought look at all the people over my head, real people and all related to me, a part of me, and I know nothing, absolutely nothing, about almost all the people on that map â€¦. When I was seventeen, walking along a street in Toronto â€¦ I knew for the first time what I was, I am , carrying on my head â€¦ not just one container or basket, but hundreds of baskets all balanced on each other, full to their tops with bones â€¦ and they were so heavy .. that either I was going to have to offload them or they were going to drive me down through the pavement to the ground
Later when saying farewell to Art and failing to persuade him to engage with his mother, she reacts to his assertion that he has nothing in common with Sophia with the angry comment
[we as humans have] the chance to know where we came from. To forget it, to forget what made us, where it might take us, itâ€™s like, I donâ€™t know. Forgetting your own head
Giving of course another explanation of the floating head â€“ that it represents the dislocation of Art from his mother. And also interesting acting as partly a counter balance to the liberal, pro-immigration, anti-Brexit message of the story as Lux's argument partly picks up on David Goodhart's arguments in The Road to Somewhere: The Populist Revolt and the Future of Politics which ideas (much as I suspect Lux and Smith would hate to admit this) were behind May's citizen's of nowhere speech.
- The examination of dysfunctional parent/child relationships. In Autumn of course Elisabeth and her mother - but here not just Art and Sophia (as discussed above and critiqued by Lux) but between Sophia and her own father. In a beautifully touching but achingly sad vignette - Sophia's father contacts her when she is a successful business woman, when he hears that Laika the space dog only lived for a few hours, as he still remembers how upset the child Sophia was at Laika orbiting earth for a week before dying. Lux also reveals to Sophia that the effects of the Yugoslavian wars have left her family ""war-wounded"" such that she cannot live with them.
Overall I felt this was an outstanding novel and stronger than the already strong Autumn.
In particular I felt that the tale was more nuanced. I have already commented above on Lux's reflections on the need to understand where we have come from. Interestingly, over time the Brexit-supporting business-focused Sophia (with her childhood sensitivity and worries, her brief affair with Art's father and resulting exposure to the art of Hepworth and others, with her run-in with some form of security services) emerges as a much deeper and rounded individual than she is seen by Art and initially by the reader, whereas the left wing anti-Brexit, pro-refugee Iris emerges as simply a serial rebel and protestor.
Finally I feel that despite much of the despair Smith and the characters have with the contemporary world and politics - there is a quiet optimism building in this book, a hope that decency and goodness will prevail. The setting of the book, starting on the day of the Winter Solstice is important and Sophie one night reflects
the shift, the reversal, from increase of darkness to increase of light, revealed that a coming back of light was at the heart of midwinter equally as much as the waning of light

,"Young Adult, Contemporary, Lgbt, Fiction",Ariel,"This is the kind of book I want to write. Which is a pretty big thing to say, I suppose.
What I really appreciated was that Nina LaCour abandoned the idea that a novel has to be entirely plot driven. This is a book about relationships and emotions and I liked being caught up in Marin's brain. I loved that it took place in winter, on an abandoned university campus, where everything amplified Marin's feelings of emptiness and isolation. I like that things like being coloured or queer were present but not plot devices. It all felt real and relevant. I also, and I cannot emphasize this enough, loved Nina LaCour's use of technology. I've made a video all about this, but I'm really irked by teenager representation that doesn't involve the internet or cellphones. Here it was masterfully intertwined. It never took me out of the story, it made it feel more grounded and real. I also loved that the book was short. It told it's story and then it stopped. It never dragged or wasted time. I love brevity, what can I say! I also really enjoyed that there was lots of cross-generational relationships - teenagers, parents, grandparents - because sometimes YA feels like a bizarre teen-only world.
I'm giving this 4 stars because I don't think it was my perfect book. I think some of Marin's reactions to things were overly angsty and that there weren't many powerful moments. I said this is the type of book I want to write because it felt like something that Nina LaCour poured herself into, something subtle and strong, a message she wanted to share. It isn't a new favourite for me, but I appreciated it lots. (less)",Positif

When you're a fan of Tijan even if you haven't read any of her works and yet you keep on tabs with her new releases, such a fool. And that's me! I regret it big time of for taking it so long to finally read her work. So I started it with Cole...
He was the leader of the mafia. I was about to all in love with him, and his name is Cole Mauricio.
Ho-lee guacamole! This book is genius! I wasn't just about to fall in love with Cole but I fallen in love with him already big time. I was reading this book from start to finish, holding my breath and was on the edge, devouring it like there's no tomorrow. I finished it in one sitting because I cannot put it down. I was glued to it the moment I started reading it and I cannot just even stop for a moment afraid I'll miss something. I don't not doing anything at all, just reading this book so intent to find out what's more to come. Gah! I was reading it with my heart and mind racing, now added up to it that sexual energy that emanates between the two leads and I was about to burst with all the feels. It was heart pounding, adrenaline rushing, heart gripping and so much more. It was E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G!
Let's start off with the characters. Cole, there's no question about him because he stole my heart. The moment I read about him, I was so excited to read more and to find out who he is, to what extent his character will reach, because as ashamed as I am, I haven't met him yet. Now see? Cole popped my Tijan cherry and I have no regrets, In fact I felt honored. This man is more than what he seems to be. When I was used to AH, jerk, mafia men with all the seriousness and darkness, I did not see him like that. Gosh! He was sweet and intense at the same time I feel like my eyes gonna bulge out from reading and my panties so soaked because just by the mere mention of his name has that effect. And then there's Addison, I love this woman. From her mourning to moving on, she was so strong even amidst the reality of who he has been sleeping to, worse, who the man he falls for. In fact, she carried it with ease and confidence. And her determination to stay with Cole without too much drama is an added bonus to me. Together, they're chemistry was perfect. I have no dull moment. In fact I was so into them that I really don't want the book to end.
You see, I read this book packed with actions wearing my emotions in my sleeve. I laugh and cried with this book and that on top of all the actions and the twist of the story I never saw coming. Seriously, I was captivated by this book and how it was written. In as much as I wanted more of Cole and his perspective, I love this book still. I guess I'll just have him linger for a long period of time in my heart and maybe wish for a book in his POV? *wink
My verdict?
Wowza! Cole was written well and it really aimed to deliver and portray brilliantly. The story flows just perfectly in a steady pace packed with emotions. I recommend this book to all mafia lover's like me. It might not be what you expect but there's no doubt you'll be hooked with this suspense, raw and gritty and hot read.

The hype is REAL.
Which means that for once Iâ€™m NOT doing the black sheep thing.
Which also means that I fucking LOVED this book.
Whis also means that I'm on cloud nine.
Confession: I didnâ€™t plan to read it. In fact, I avoided it like the plague. I even removed it from my shelves as soon as I read the blurb and some of the reviews. A Hollywood's newest heartthrob, a weak heroine, a celibate heroineâ€¦blah blah blahâ€¦ Just NO.
But when 99% of your GR friends who you trust 5-star a book, you donâ€™t say NO to it.
There are so many great reviews of this book already, there's nothing more I can add.
So I'll just say that this: Things are not always what they seem.
Because this book is AWESOME.
Itâ€™s GROVEL heaven.
Itâ€™s ANGST heaven.
Itâ€™s SECOND CHANCE ROMANCE heaven.
Itâ€™s STRONG AND SMART HEROINE heaven.
(That â€˜weakâ€™ heroine from the blurb? She is one of the strongest heroines Iâ€™ve read about.)
Did I have any issues? I did. But this book is written so beautifully (NOT in a cheesy way) that I canâ€™t remember a thing.

,"Fantasy, Fiction, Epic Fantasy, Dragons, High Fantasy",Jackie,"Having followed the story from the beginning, Assassin's Apprentice, to here I was so nervous, waiting for this to come out. Turning the last page of the previous book my heart hit a wall. How could it end there..... well, it didn't.
I produce the UK cover art for Robin's books, and I knew this would be the third in the trilogy, and the cover art would have to be the best I'd done. Robin fed me a short piece of the book when I asked her about the cover and oh it was worse than reading none, because then, of course, I wanted more.
And then she sent me the manuscript.
When you read to produce the cover art you read in a different way, searching the text for a key, an image. The trouble is that Robin writes so well that I get picked up by the story and carried along, forgetting it's work ( please don't hate me). And this book is everything I ever wanted and more. Things I couldn't imagine. It's like being in a boat in a storm at sea at times. You can't breath, you can't read fast enough.
Sketch after sketch I did and it was knocked back by the editor as being a plot spoiler, so I can't show them, and then Robin talked me through the towers. The bee is an obvious motive. I can't say more.
I only read the unedited text. I know the book has been edited and honed and polished since then, so it is with great excitement that I await a proof copy of the book. When I get it I will lock all the door, pretend I have gone away on holiday, admit no one, speak to no one, do no work, until I've read the book, this time for the pure pleasure of the story.
Because that's what it is. A masterpiece that spins a tale woven around the difference between justice and vengeance. (less)",Netral
,"Fantasy, Dragons, Romance, Paranormal, Paranormal Romance, Shapeshifters",Suzanne (Under the Covers Book blog),"I kind of liked this...kind of didn't...
I'm feeling lazy so I am going to list my mixed up thoughts about this book in a list:
1. The romance was mainly background stuff. Which, is fine as long as the story is strong enough to hold my attention...
2. ...the story wasn't that strong. It didn't really hold my attention. It was spread over too many characters and although what was happening was important it wasn't necessarily interesting.
3. I loved seeing all the characters from the previous books. It's fun to revisit characters you know and love. However, it was only quick shallow visits, so although it was nice, it was ultimately unsatisfying.
Overall thoughts:
I thought this book was okay, not my favourite book in the series, I just didn't feel like there was much to really delve in to. The romance was light touch, the story didn't give you much to hang on to, I just felt there wasn't much to be drawn in by. (less)",Positif

Her whole family is devastated when her big brother Tommy is suddenly killed in a cage fight after a punch to the head. As a competitive MMA fighter, Tommy trained for the fight that could make his career, but instead it ended his life & left his wife a widow.
Michael Larson is an MMA fighter from Houston, Texas. He's worked hard to make a name for himself in the MMA cage. Fighting had been his salvation & his sanctuary. It had saved him years ago and now it felt like his damnation & his own personal hell after his recent opponent died in the ring because of him. Mike feels responsible for destroying the Dugas family & wants to ease their pain. He's so sorry & vows to himself to somehow make things right. He decides to attend the funeral & pay his respects.
Savannah is stunned to see Mike Larson at her brother's funeral. He looks so broken, she agrees to speak with him. She can tell he's seeking forgiveness & desperate to make things better. Mike is nothing like Savannah expected him to be. He has this tough persona on T.V., but in person he's kind and sincere. She has trouble dealing with her grief & anger, and facing the man that is the source of her pain.
Mike continues to reach out to Savannah. He's so torn up about what happened with Tommy, and she was the only one willing to listen to him & hear him out. Savannah finds herself drawn to Mike. She knows it's probably wrong & her family wouldn't approve, but he's there for her. He becomes her safe place & where she finds comfort. Over time she can't fight the way her body craves him or how her heart beats only for him. He becomes her solace & helps her heal with his love.
-She'd never felt so deliciously weak, so shaken to her core from a kiss.
-He possessed her. Fingers in her hair, holding her fast while his mouth devoured hers.
-""I want this.""
-""I want you.""
Mike's thought about retiring, but fighting has always been everything he's about. How do you give up the one thing that makes you who you are. The thing that keeps you sane. Can Savannah be with Mike if he decides to keep fighting? She's scared of losing him the way she lost her brother. Can she risk going through that kind of loss again?
I really loved this book! It was so damn hot! I adored Mike & I can't wait for the other Larson brother's books! I'm dying for rock star Zane Larson's book! I need more of these delicious brothers!
-It was everything. Everything she'd been looking for.
-She'd been in the arms of the man the world thought she should hate. But she loved him.

,"Romance, Contemporary, Contemporary Romance, Fiction",Gretchen (About That Story),"EPIC! That's the word I keep coming back to when I think of this story with all its amazing conclusions and the trilogy itself. It was an epic adventure with so many twists and turns into the land of bourbon that's full of lies, deceit, hope, and love. It was truly a phenomenal story!
Devilâ€™s Cut is the final book in The Bourbon Kings trilogy and I was on the edge of my seat digesting everything I learned, absorbing all the answers that were given. I loved all the little breadcrumbs that were coming into play. My emotions where everywhere. Shock and awe, anger. Heat. Love. Sadness. I was so very choked up because some of these characters truly go through a metamorphosis. Watching this very broken family, heal and endure and stand up and be strong has been a true pleasure. Every single person was just full and rich, making them come alive on the page. The world the author has created is full of so much depth, steeped in history and tradition. It was breathtaking!
There was a lot happening since so many stories are woven together but it was not overwhelming to me. There were so many things in play. Edward. The Bourbon Bradford Company. The different romantic relationships and friendships. It was just so incredibly full. Every descriptions was perfect to me. The pace was amazing. The build spot on and at times, heart stopping. I wanted all these answers and got them, so many amazing happily ever after's and some sad ones too. Twice I flat out bawled. There was so much intrigue and drama intertwined. As I read and all these details unfolded and loose ends where tied up, as happy as I was, I didn't want it to end. This crazy, privileged family and their friends, all the turmoil they went through was just so amazingly entertaining in a I-can't-get-enough-of-this-saga-and-these-people kind of way.
The writing was incredible. The attention to detail was stellar. J. R. Ward is an exceptional storyteller. It's like I could picture it all playing out in my head, so very Dynasty-esq. I loved the different POVs, all the storylines happening and overlapping culminating into one amazing ending. I also appreciated the timing of each POV and how they were presented. I loved the fullness of the story, and the richness of the characters truly amazed me. I was rooting for them and cheered for them, my heart broke for them and I cried for them. It was just amazing.
From the bourbon to family, all the answers were given and I am beside myself with the conclusion. I want to go back and reread it and experience it all again. A must read story and series!!!

,"Nonfiction, Science, Technology, Politics, Business",Ietrio,"An old man and his fears. The good old times were better. But the old man is not smart enough to know the old times were better because they were past, hence easy to manage.
Otherwise, a mindless primitivist statement. Same concerns were generated at every new item in the life of humans. The industrial was bad. But the poverty of today has a comfort few kings had only two centuries ago. The car was bad, but we all depend on it and even those hypocrite enough to dump it are glad to use it from time to time. Synthetic fibers? Not natural, yet fewer people die of frost today than before them. And that is only about clothes.
The problem in the end is not the argument, as everyone is entitled to their views. Is the qualifications that are lacking. (less)",Netral

Prudence is a smart woman, despite the difficult position she is in; she is a society woman in 1888, who is severely limited in what she can do and where she can go, complicated by being in mourning.

,"History, Biography, Nonfiction, Military History, Civil War, North American Hi..., American History, Politics, Presidents",Jeanette,"This is quite a biography. When I was young they taught me Grant's role, especially in his Presidency years, to be significantly less important than I believe it was. And to completely over blow his alcoholism as ""practiced"". But regardless of my former nuance of detail considering Grant or how he has been taught, this book made him come alive. It holds depth of his times too, to an incredible degree.
He seemed to be the very best of the best that is human when under extreme and completely ""present"" pressure. That's rare.
The book itself has a few flaws, mostly in length of detail that's rather repetitive and some that is quite tangent, but you really do get the person beyond the General, the politician, or the husband/ family man. But I think it could have been done at 2/3rds the length.
There are some aspects, considering the humongous detail of most personal interrelationship minutia and the quite considerable portions of his life when he was sick with various infirmities, let alone his last cancer when he dictated his own history- that I thought were fully there, but not as slanted to be as dire, unusual, unfortunate as they were. Several issues not set into the much wider picture of essential to the ""heal"" and USA identity too. (The economics post-war especially.) I wonder what could have been the difference if he had been ""good with money"" himself or understood, in any intuitive sense, how it works. His indifference and ignorance with wanting or achieving wealth (and not understanding that ""friends"" could think very differently about this), not just within his own political/life sphere either, seems not as much a concern as it should have been in such a lengthy study?? He was poor at it. Beyond the trusting matters or fierce loyalties which were not deserved, he didn't understand economics.
But what bravery considering that he was forced to go to West Point and that it wasn't even his 2nd choice to be set upon the military path- and where that took his life in totality. When I think of him now, I will focus on the small and slender as an arrow 116 lbs horseman whose jump was the climax of his commencement ceremony. A record that still stands. (less)",Positif
,"Nonfiction, Humor, Autobiography, Memoir, Biography, Comedy ",Liz Willard,"This book takes blurbs of what famous people have said on the podcast and groups them together by topic (relationships, parenting, failure, etc), and the result is pretty uneven. Some of the impact of each story seems lessened by taking it out of context and plopping it amongst other stories; there isn't really a thread to follow. I fully confess I found the parts by people I'd actually heard of more interesting than those of people unfamiliar to me (a lot of comedians and character actors, some of whom I googled, some I didn't care enough to do so). Overall I came away with the feeling I often have when reading something written by people in Hollywood... that actors, musicians, and other creative-types experience a lot more highs and lows, and extremes of any and every kind, than your average person.

,"Romance, M M Romance, War, Military Fiction, Contemporary",Karla,"4.5 stars!
What a rollercoaster of emotions at least that how I felt about the relationship between Apollo/Dylan.
Apollo lost his husband a couple of years ago he mourns him deeply and feels like he'll never love again. Dylan is Apollos's best friend younger brother, Dylan has always had a crush on Apollo. When circumstances brings them face to face they both feel an undeniable attraction to each other.
At first I thought I was going to be frustrated with Apollo's push and pull but as the story moved along I felt for him especially for his two daughters. But did he annoyed me sometimes? why yes! he surely did! But I understood him, and the emotions he was battling. Then again I felt like Dylan wasn't upfront with his own feeling towards Apollo. So I can honestly say they both made mistakes and the lack of communication caused them both pain.
I enjoyed seeing their feelings slowly get deeper from a physical attraction to love. This is the kind of angst I love, it's the kind that grabs your heart and squeezes out all the emotions this characters live. I love both guys they were both passionate and their sexual encounters were dam hot!
Apollo's daughters were so adorable they added a sweetness to the story an enjoyable read for sure. I'm loving this series so much can't wait for the next couple.â¤ï¸

,"Nonfiction, Feminism, Writing, Essays",Ben Babcock,"I suppose I should start with one of those disclaimers about how I received a free electronic copy of this from NetGalley and Algonquin Young Readers. However, I also preordered two hard copies with my own money (OK, someone elseâ€™s money in gift card form) even before that request was approved. But why wait a whole three weeks when I could read it earlier than that? Thatâ€™s how excited I am for Here We Are: 44 Voices Write, Draw, and Speak About Feminism for the Real World. It turns out that this book is everything I wanted, and more.
I really like this trend of telling me how many contributors there are in the title of the work, because it saves me from having to count. Suffice it to say, Iâ€™m not going to review each piece individually. I will point out that Kelly Jensen has clearly made the effort to be as inclusive and intersectional as possible in this book. Here We are features pieces from white women, Black women, Indigenous women, trans men and trans women, straight women, gay women, and even that rarest of breeds, yes, the straight white male. The contributors are of various ages, professions, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Indeed, pretty much the only thing that unites all of them is that they are in this book, and they identify as feminist.
Readers wonâ€™t see themselves in every contributor and every piece in Here We Are. And thatâ€™s kind of the point. The essays and other pieces in this collection seek to give advice, sure. Beyond this, though, they simply provide perspectives. Readers wonâ€™t see themselves in every contributor, but they will hopefully identify with some of the contributors. And they will get a chance to hear from voices whose experiences are very different from their own. For example, Constance Augusta Zaberâ€™s â€œDragging Myself into Self-Loveâ€ would surely resonate with many boys:
Looking back, I can recognize how hard puberty must have been for them, but at the time, I envied those girls. I envied their pierced ears, their lip gloss, their long hair, their shoes that werenâ€™t boring old sneakers. I was envious that they were allowed to make choices with clothes and makeup that were off limits to me. By the eighth grade, Iâ€™d been exposed to the idea that gender roles were created by humans and were more arbitrary than natural (thank you, Internet!), but that sort of abstract information is useless in the face of classmates who would mock a boy for having a purple backpack.
(Emphasis mine.) Although I perform gender in a fairly standard, masculine way, I definitely understand where Zaber is coming from and can identify with chafing at some of the restrictions placed upon people who perform gender as male. For boys who are considering that they might be trans or nonbinary or agender or simply prefer more fashion choices, this is an essay that tells them they are not alone. For the girls who are the primary target audience of Here We Are, itâ€™s a glimpse into how feminist thought and action benefits all people, regardless of gender.
Here We Are is unequivocal in its inclusiveness:
Feminists can identify as female, male, transgender, gender queer, or any other way they wish to. They can choose to choose no identity at all or choose one identity today and a different one next week. What physical parts individuals have or do not have has no bearing on their feminism nor on their right to be part of the feminism party. All that matters is that they believe in equality for every individual.
Whether you identify as a trans man, move fluidly among genders, enjoy having sex freely, or prefer not to have sex at all, you belong here and you matter.
(Yeah, a little asexual representation there. Not a whole lot, unfortunately, but a little. I wish Jensen had included an asexual contributor to discuss how a lack of attraction is normal and OK, and maybe even someone who is aromantic or whose romantic orientation differs from their sexual orientation. Also, in case youâ€™re reading this and wondering: yes, there really are feminism parties. They are every second Thursday, and like the dark side, we have cookies, although we donâ€™t have imperialist oppression of entire planetary systems.)
Mikki Kendall also puts it very well in her essay, â€œFacets of Feminismâ€, when she says, â€œA feminism that is exclusionary, that makes objects out of some women and saviors out of others, is implicitly harmful.â€¦ An inclusive feminism is a more effective feminism.â€ And earlier in this chapter, the book reminds us that liking problematic media doesnâ€™t disqualify you as a feminist either, that â€œitâ€™s from these problematic representations that great feminist dialogue emergesâ€, and then cites one of my favourite problematic shows, Supernatural. This is a salient point to remember in an age that bombards us with media representation that is often simultaneously problematic and entertaining, and I appreciate that Here We Are takes the time to counter the myth that feminism means hating men, hating yourself, or indeed, hating everythingâ€”it does not.
The word feminist is certainly more in the popular mind than it was when I was a teenager in the early noughties. My adolescence straddled the divide between pre- and post-social media, as well as pre- and post-smartphone; in Grade 8 it was all about the LiveJournal and the GeoCities, and by the time I was graduating high school Facebook had thrown open its doors to the general public and the iPhone had just heralded the beginning of the smartphone era. In this environment, feminism was something we didnâ€™t really discuss too much as teenagers. I ran with a pretty smart group of kids (after my first high school closed in Grade 10, I took to eating lunch in the band wing with the â€œband geeksâ€, despite my lack of musical talent, because lots of them were from my old school and it seemed preferable to the noisy cafeteria). We were reasonably enlightened, Iâ€™d like to say, and we talked about these kinds of issues. But textbooks and theories and that kind of academic rigour were not yet on the horizon, so we didnâ€™t always have the language required to grapple with them.
This book is much more accessible. It covers pretty much everything and anything related to feminism to one degree or another. I appreciate that it has separate chapters on sex and relationships, since these are very different but often conflated concepts. I like that it has a combination of personal essays, reprinted essays, interviews, comics and drawings, and lists. The â€œscrapbook styleâ€ book is not a form I want to read all the time, but I acknowledge its appeal. As an adult and a professional and (gasp) an intellectual, I can read all the academic theory books about feminism that I want. I canâ€™t really put those into the hands of teenagers, however, and expect them to have the same eye-opening experiences that I do. Instead, Here We Are is a book with ideas, stories, and advice they can take an act on immediately.
Even as feminism becomes more popular, it also becomes a commodity. Corporations are happy to co-opt feminist slogans and terminology if it means they can sell feminism. â€œBuy this thing to make you more feminist!â€ â€œBuy this thing to support our feminist initiatives!â€ Buy, buy, buy. â€œBuy this to learn the ultimate secret to feminismâ€¦â€ Except there is no secret. There is no one, right way to be feminist. There is no feminist checklist that, if followed, will make you the perfect, unprivileged, unbiased, feminist person.
OK, I lied. There is a secret. Do you want to know what it is?
Most young people are already feminists.
They might not know it, and if they know it, they might not readily admit to it (because that can come with a social cost they are unwilling to pay). But young people, by and large, believe in their own empowerment. They believe in equality for all genders. They donâ€™t understand what the fuss is about if you love someone of the same genderâ€”or if you donâ€™t fall in love at all. The stories we see in the news about proms being shut down because a girl wants to bring another girl, or wear a tuxedo, or wears a dress that is too shortâ€”itâ€™s not other teens shutting down these events, creating this fuss. Itâ€™s the adults who are unwilling to open their minds and change their views. I canâ€™t remember who said this, but young people are always on the winning side of history.
Here We Are embraces this youth power and energy rather than talking down to it. It sees the feminist, good and bad and hidden and out, in everyone and speaks to them. Itâ€™s a little bit Oprah, I guess: â€œYou can be feminist! And you can be feminist! And you can be feminist!â€, but I donâ€™t see this as a bad thing. The worst thing we, adult progressives and feminists and allies, can do at this point is to ignore, condescend, or silence young people trying to speak up, learn about, and claim a feminist identity. Here We Are is a book for youth that is proudly, loudly feminist and tells young people that they can shout about (or not, as they choose) being feminist too. I think thatâ€™s pretty cool.

,"Fantasy, Mythology, Young Adult",P,"â€œPlease get off!â€ the trooper wailed. â€œPlease and thank you!â€
I hysterically laughed my ass off while I was reading this book on the BTS. The Dark Prophecy picks up after what happened in The Hidden Oracle. Lester, aka Apollo, teamed up with Leo and his girlfriend and comes to Indianapolis to pursue the prophecy he was bestowed. The tone of this book is as good as the first book but the pace is quite slow. Apollo reminded me of Deadpool talking with readers with his sarcastic tone. His development is promiment and what I have expected. His attitude is frivolous as always, you know, but it's the point of this series why it's so much differrent from the Percy Jackson series despite the fact that it's sharing the same world-building.
Leo, on the other hand, is a solid character in this book. Although he is oafish at times, he still got my attention as he did in The Heroes of Olympus. Moreover, the emperor, Commodus, is exactly a narcissistic character that I almost died of laughing, and I think he might be my favorite villain of all time. Meg is one of the best protagonists I've ever seen. From the first half of this book, I thought her character was such a typical heroine, and I had no idea how wrong I was until the very end of this book. She's so intricate !
â€œHe looked like a hallucinating ballerina in boxer shorts,â€
The griffins are excellent that (view spoiler) However, sometimes I didn't get what Lester were talking about, I knew it's all his music or rhyme, but it's also one of the reasons why I didn't enjoy this fully.
The ending of this led me to the long wait for the next book. Yet I have a gut feeling it's gonna be as exciting as the fourth book of the Percy Jackson series.

,"Young Adult, Science Fiction, Dystopia, Science Fiction, Horror, Zombies, Apocalyptic, Post Apocalyptic",Sarah,"I was really looking forward to reading Tegan's story but I have to admit I was a little wary when I realised it was going to involve a romance between her and the Uroch vanguard Szarok. I'd been rooting for her and James in the earlier books so I was disappointed to see my ship sinking and to be honest I just couldn't see how I'd be able to get on board with a relationship between a human and one of the uroch, it wasn't something I could quite get my head around! I'm very happy to say that Ann Aguirre totally proved me wrong with Vanguard though and I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
Tegan has saw the worst of what humanity has to offer before she was rescued by Deuce and Fade and although her life has changed dramatically since then and her training as a healer has brought her a great amount of respect she's still wary of people in general and men in particular which is completely understandable. She has a great sense of right and wrong though and in spite of everything she's been through she's incredibly compassionate and caring so it shouldn't be much of a surprise when she automatically connects with Szarok after seeing him being ostracised by the people around her. She understands exactly what the uroch risked when they chose to help humanity and she's angry for the way he is treated now that they are asking for help in return. I don't want to go into too much detail but I loved the slow build of their relationship, the way they gradually let their guards down around each other and learn to trust and the slowly growing friendship that blossoms into a very unlikely attraction. They were so sweet together and it didn't take long for me to start rooting for the pair of them.
I also found it incredibly interesting to see how the world was being put back together after the big battle. We get a chance to catch up with a lot of the previous characters which was nice but it was definitely Tegan and Szarok who were the stars of this book. James has a story of his own which I enjoyed but I have to admit I wasn't as invested what was happening with him even though I liked Millie too. This was a fitting end to the series, it tied up a lot of loose ends and gave us a good idea about what life would be like for humanity and the uroch in the future and I'm very glad we got this chance to revisit the world Ann Aguirre has created.

First, this book made me miss the Unbreakable Bond series (that is one of my favorites series ever) so much! Iâ€™ll definitely be re-reading it soon.
Secondly, this was a great start to a spin-off series. It follows characters that we were introduced in the Unbreakable Bond Series and Iâ€™m really happy with the one they pick to start.
This book was GOOD! I was with so much expectation for this one, mostly because is writing by the same authors who wrote one of my favorite series ever, so yeah, I had love for it before I even started reading.
And I loved it.
There was action, romance, sexy times (like always, so damn good writing), development, friendships, strong, amazing characters, with a lot of funny and emotional moments.
The writing was great, the story had a great plot (again, like always) and I just love m/m romances so much. Is consuming me. Not that I mind.
I adore Geoffrey when he appeared in the UB series and I loved him in here. Sven is great too. Heâ€™s describe has a viking was not to like?? Lol.
I love them.
You donâ€™t necessarily need to have read the Unbreakable Bond series to read this one, but I recommend it simply because is fucking awesome and youâ€™ll be missing some great stuff.

The book is a cute, low-angst, sweet-as-sin romance story, with loveable MCs, who are just so adorkable, and a nice enough storyline.
The book started and ended on a great note, no doubt. But it's the middle that has made me give it the rating that I have. The middle dragged for me a bit. And I say this because even though I had a very hectic schedule, I've been known to keep my sleep time at bay just to get further into a good story that I have sunk my teeth and claws into, but this one didn't make me fight my body's needs to get to know the characters just that much more. Rather, I found myself easily succumbing to the need to rest and leave the book for the next day. And this is one of the factors which tell me how much I enjoyed a book.
So even though Gabe and Jake(y) were cute individuals and adorable as a couple, even though I liked the story well enough in general, I didn't find anything to grab my attention tenaciously and not let go.
But the ending surprise did remind me of the dragon shifters series, by the author's another pen name, that I had read the first part of and enjoyed a lot, so now I'll switch to that series rather than go to know more about this Byrne family. (less)",Positif

Simply put, I got bored.
Geoffrey's sassiness and Sven's reluctance to admit that he is into Geoffrey was fun at first. But when you almost reach half the book with them still toying around like teenagers, it gets kinda boring and repetitive.
Plus, the mystery stalker seems kinda lame. I mean, the idea was great. But the execution could have been done a little bit better IMO. Everything seems like a child's play. Like a plot that is over-sweetened. Even with the stalker and the ""dangers"" in place, it seems pretty predictable and obvious to me that in the end everything will end well.

,"Food and Drink, Autobiography, Memoir, Nonfiction, Biography, Cooking",Carvanz,"Wow! I absolutely loved the latest in Suzanne Wrightâ€™s Mercury Pack! It is everything I want in a shifter romance.
Gwen is being harassed after witnessing a lone female shifter being beaten by a group of human thugs. Although the female has recanted her statement, due to similar harassment, Gwen refuses to do so. Too many times has she had to keep quiet against injustice and she wonâ€™t do it this time.
When Zander arrives at the B&B where Gwen lives and works, his wolf instantly backs away from her. The wolf is wary and guarded and confusing the heck out of Zander. After becoming aware of the trouble at Gwenâ€™s door, he steps up to assist her by offering her and her family protection until she is able to testify.
Gwen is one tough heroine, able to protect herself in her own way and I loved that she could so easily get under Zanderâ€™s skin and drive him crazy. Zander knows that Gwen is independent, but he also knows something she doesnâ€™t and heâ€™s not going anywhere. The way he carefully handles the situation endeared him to me along with his protective instincts and desires.
This is a fast paced, action filled story with a couple of storylines running through it that kept me engaged the whole time.

,"Young Adult, Contemporary, Lgbt, Fiction",Larry H,"The minute I received an email from NetGalley promoting Benjamin Alire SÃ¡enz's new book, I jumped on it and submitted a request for an advance copy. I absolutely loved Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe (see my review), so I figured even if this one wasn't that good, I still had to read it. Needless to say, I was so pleased to get approved right away, and I began the book the second I finished my previous one.
The Inexplicable Logic of My Life is a different book than Aristotle and Dante... , but man, was it special. I have a hellacious cold, making sleeping (and breathing, really) fairly impossible in my current state, so last night I read nearly the entire book, between 11:00 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. Needless to say, this is how I ended up:
Sal is ready to start his senior year of high school. It's going to be a pivotal year with so much on the horizon, but while his childhood best friend Samantha can think of nothing more than going to college as far away from El Paso as she can (no matter what her mother says), he's getting more and more stressed about the potential for change. Suddenly this anxiety is manifesting itself via angerâ€”all he wants to do is hit people. Whether it's the idiot who called his father a faggot, someone who called him a pinche gringo (even though he is white, he was adopted by his Mexican father), or one of Sam's bad-guy boyfriends, he suddenly can't stop using his fists, and he doesn't understand why, and he is afraid of how people will react if they knew how angry he was.
""But Sam, she had this image of me that I was a good boy, and she was in love with that image. She was in love with simple, uncomplicated, levelheaded Sally. And I didn't know how to tell her that I wasn't all those beautiful things she thought I was. That things were changing, and I could feel it but couldn't put it into words.""
Sadly, life throws them curve after curve in this crucial year, and Sal must deal with some major emotional crises, and come to terms with who he is, and what becoming a man really means. But at the same time, he realizes once again the power of friendship and family, of words, of loving and being loved, and of giving people a chance. This is a beautiful, emotional, heart-warming, and life-affirming book, and although there was perhaps a little too much melodrama to deal with in the plot, I applaud SÃ¡enz for not taking the story down a few paths I feared he might.
One of the reasons I love SÃ¡enz's writing so much is that he has such a love for his characters that you can't help loving them, too, and seeing them in your mind's eye. This book is 450+ pages long yet I could have read more, although I might have gotten dehydrated from all of the crying! (And not just sad crying, but good crying, too.)
He uses beautiful imagery and creates some poetic moments, even if at times some friction would have been avoided if people just said what they felt. But ultimately, this is one of those books that teaches you to let yourself be loved, and that no matter what your background or life situation is, you still are entitled to dream and believe in yourself.
I'll sit and wait for SÃ¡enz's next book, readying for this again:

,"Fiction, Cultural, India, Abandoned, Literary Fiction, Contemporary",Arnav Sinha,"I was in school in 1997-98, living in a small township. Most of my reading was limited to the age-appropriate fare on offer at our school library, which I had far outgrown (and read twice over). All of a sudden, this new book by an unheard of Indian author was being covered by the print media (and the one TV news program), and it felt like a good bet to spend my hard-earned pocket money on. The hardcover cost about Rs. 400, which seemed like a big amount for someone who had only bought 2nd-hand Archie comic books before that. In my most impulsive purchase till then, I went ahead and bought TGoST in my next visit to the nearest town.
I started reading the book right there while waiting for my parents to get their own (non-book-related) shopping done, continued to read through most of the lunch, and on our trip back home, and late into the night. I cried when Ammu said 'Naaley'. Partly because the book had ended. Partly because nothing I had read had ever hit me so hard before that. Not much has since then either.
I have loved Arundhati Roy's first and, for a long time, only work of fiction deeply. It's the only novel I have read several times, and probably loved it more each time I have read it. It was the book that sustained me when I lived the life of a hermit preparing for my college entrance exams. That precious copy I had bought in school was gifted to my closest friend in engineering college. A number of other copies were bought after that and gifted to people dear to me. Heck, it was even my topic when I prepared for a version of Mastermind for our college quizzing club. And I tend to judge people often by whether they like the book or not.
So this 20-year wait for her next novel has been excruciatingly long. From what I have figured over this period from her nonfiction writing, even if she had written a book with a blindfold on, I would have found it difficult to completely dislike it.
With that hideously long preamble done, let me happily state that I mostly loved this novel too. Her crazy word play, those lovingly constructed characters, their heart-breaking relationships, surviving and not surviving through what time, geography and the Indian Government throw at them, are all there. At over 400 pages, it is not a short novel by any standards, but my interest never flagged (big deal for me) and I finished it in one sitting (even bigger deal).
(I don't talk about the story itself, but talk about the basic themes, but some readers might find even that a spoiler this early in the book's release history, so beware.)
The novel starts off in Old Delhi and spends a long time with a group of kinnars ('eunuchs' would probably be the literal, but impolite, translation). And then almost suddenly changes track and moves to Kashmir, with another set of characters. As one would expect, it all ties up eventually, but I would have liked to spend more time with the Delhi crowd (probably the only time I would say that about any Delhi crowd). In any case, members of the entire cast, even the least important ones, are beautifully realized. (Like Ammu in TGoST, there is a prominent character here too inspired in many ways by Roy herself.) This, I feel, is Roy's great strength. No matter how idiosyncratic the characters might be, they seem way too real, like you know them, and so, are worth caring for.
Roy's even greater strength is the relationships. Because, like the previous novel, this one is also primarily about love. Love in its many many weird manifestations, between humans, humans and animals, humans and dead humans, humans and dead animals, and well you get the idea. I would like to swear that I have grown older in the last 20 years, less susceptible to those tear-jerking tricks that authors employ. But like Frank Capra movies, Ms Roy's writing does some things that I can't explain.
So I will remain a fanboy for now. Readers strongly opposed to Roy's political views might have a more difficult task at their hands with this book though, because the novel covers the whole gamut of issues dear to her - Kashmir (the main plot), naxalism, capitalism, casteism, Gujarat riots, 1984 riots, rise of Hindu nationalism, and maybe more - and generally takes a stand not conforming to the widely held middle and upper class, 'mainland', view prevalent these days in India.
Even for me, who appreciates Roy's contrarian stands, without always completely agreeing with them, the novel seemed to edge very close to becoming a propaganda tool first and a novel as an afterthought in places. Heck, she even uses the phrase 'algebra of infinite justice' at a point. Some of her other book titles might also find mention, but I was not looking closely.
There are unflattering depictions of characters based on AB Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh, Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal. And, of course, Roy's favorite Gujarat's Lalla, who happens to be a very popular PM currently. For these reasons, it won't be surprising if in the way things are handled these days (in India and in many other parts of the world), there would be widespread criticism of the book (some nutcase might even call for its banning!) by many who haven't even read it.
We tend to be particularly sensitive to how India is portrayed in front of foreigners, and this litany of accusations (which is the only thing many might see here), this criticism of the 'stupidification' of the country, might seem like too much bad PR by a book that is bound to be feted and translated all over. That is, in fact, the only reason why these issues would antagonize most Indians. Otherwise, partly because these issues have been raised much too often already by the media and other authors, and partly because those who will generally read the book are fortunate to lead fairly comfortable lives, we have long become immune to them.

,"Young Adult, Science Fiction, Fantasy, Dystopia",AJ,"Within the first page of this book, I knew that it was not for me. When our erstwhile heroine is being held at knife point but is taking the time to wax poetic about the looks of the man holding her thus, you know you've got a garbage fire of a book on your hands.
You'd think by now I'd have learned to just ignore the Kindle First offerings. If a book was great, they wouldn't have to give it away to try to generate initial buzz.
Anyway, The Breaking Light is the worst sort of trope-laden ""star crossed lovers"" YA SF/F novel. It's the sort of thing people think of when they talk shit about YA or SF/F. It gives teenagers and their books a bad name. It wants to be some sort of Romeo and Juliet with an additional element of coming from literal different income levels.
The first problem with this book hits you right off the bat. It's the insta-lust between Arden and... whatever the fuck the guy's name is, I already forgot. Cade? Something like that. There's no reason for them to feel such a strong connection to each other, but there it is. And TBH I could forgive that if there was some sizzling hot tension to go with it, but this book never gets sexier than kisses.
This book really lost me though when Arden realizes that Cade (I'm gonna call him Cade because I'm too lazy to go look it up) is in a forced engagement and she decides that they both have it equally bad. Yes, she is stuck living in the lightless depths of the planet they're on, her parents are dying of Vitamin D deficiency, her brother is a drug addict, she has to sell drugs to stay alive, she has to worry about losing her life in a gang war, she lives in extreme poverty, and he has to marry a friend he likes but doesn't love. TOTALLY THE SAME.
By the way, my husband is a biology major. He says that if you don't get Vitamin D, you just get rickets.
None of the science in this book makes any sense. Why do people have to get Vit-D injections? They grow meta-grains, whatever the fuck those are (lots of things in this book have future techy sounding words attached to them without any explanation of what they are, just to make it more sci-fi-ish I guess), why aren't the meta-grains fortified with the vitamins people need? We've already been putting Vitamin D in our milk forever.
I could go on and on and on and on but the long and short of it is that I hated this book and I hated it even more when I got to the end and saw that the author is an English major because the writing is TERRIBLE.
My only regret is that since I read at night before bed, I couldn't live-tweet every terrible thing about this stupid book, instead I would just mutter ""oh my god"" to myself and save up the worst bits to tell my partner about in the morning. (less)",Negatif
,"Mystery, Romance, Fiction, Crime",Corinaâ˜žBookTwinsReviews,"As always a book by JD Robb has to be on the very top of my to-read list. Actually, her two new releases each year are something I'm looking forward to all year. It's amazing that after 44 books this series is going as strong for me as at the beginning.
Secrets in Death was a fantastic read. The story was captivating from the very first page, and even though some books are better than other - it never stops being a thrilling ride for me. This time the plot was oddly fascinating even though it wasn't as brutal and as lined with corpses as it's usually the case.
I loved the slower pace. Not only for myself but also for Dallas. Less late nights and zero sleep. OMG I sound like I'm living the book myself. :D But that's how I feel when reading her books. I feel like meeting friends and family - catching up with everyone is the highlight of reading a JD Robb book. She managed to accumulate the BEST supporting cast EVER. And most say hello in every book.
I hope she'll never stop writing this series. It would leave a HUGE hole in my life.
This is a rather short review, but honestly, most who know JD Robb know what her books are about. And for everyone that hasn't read any of her books yet: If you love suspense and need some romance in your books, this series is for you.
The In Death series has the BEST serial couple (except for Kate and Curran, and Elena and Raphael) - Dallas and Roarke have been together since book 3 I believe. They met in book one but don't get truly together until book 3. They grew with each book, changed to the better because of the other person, compromised and fell deeper in love with each case.
On top of amazing main characters, you'll meet the best cast ever, a diverse group of truly unique personalities. You'll get to know them, and care deeply about each and everyone. Dallas/Eve has complex relationships with most of the cast. A hate/love/I-can-barely-stand-you relationship with the butler. A mentor and younger sister bond with her partner. She has a mother figure in the departments psychiatrist. A father figure in the geek squad captain. And the most hilarious long-term hide and seek tradition with the candy thief. So many characters to look forward to and none is bland or boring. Everyone has a place in this intricate series.
And let's not forget one of my most cherished aspects of this series - Eve's (Dallas) mutilation and analyzation of english idioms. Every single book has at least three to four idioms that she screws up completely and then tries to justify the utter meaninglessness of said idiom. She makes me crack up every single time!!!!
Something else to know, this series plays in the future - around 2050. There are lots of interesting changes, inventions, and crimes to salivate over.
There is really not much else to say about this series. Just the fact that I've been religiously reading her books twice a year - always immediately when they've been released - and that should be proof enough that I absolutely adore this author's work.
Try it for yourself and be prepared for an amazing roller coaster ride. BTW I'm jealous of everyone that's starting this series. Sometimes I wish I could wipe my memory just to start from the beginning.

,"Fiction, Mystery, Adult, Thriller, Mystery Thriller",Karyl,"Marc Laurent has been taken hostage while working for Pepsi in Karachi, Pakistan. While being held prisoner, one of his captors, a woman whom he's told to call Josephine, asks him why he didn't return home for the funeral of his 19-year-old daughter Claire, who had been murdered the month before. Then over the next few nights, Josephine weaves together a story of a future Claire who had survived her attack and gone on to make a life for herself. So this is really a story within a story within a story wrapped around a story.
My issue with it, however, is that people don't really talk like they do in Lowe's book. I understand it's a book about storytelling, but I've yet to meet, in this day and age, a master storyteller who's able to evoke times and places and events so vividly, and to have her audience absorbing all she's being told without question. The reality just isn't there. We've got entire chapters with one character telling a story, and this character is a character in Josephine's story, who may just be a figment of Marc's imagination -- because who's to say what's reality in this book?
I personally didn't care for the main plot, in which Marc is kidnapped in Pakistan. For me, that's a little too much manipulation and a little too much of Islamophobia; it's too much an issue in real life, so I don't care to have it in my books as well.
While I can appreciate the writing, I feel that Lowe's storytelling would have been better served in traditional prose, not as a character speaking aloud to an audience.
Not a book I would personally recommend. (less)",Netral

,"Mystery, Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction",Susan Johnson,"Maisie Dobbs is hired by a member of the Belgian embassy in this 13th installment of the series. A Belgian refugee has been murdered and the embassy wants more of an investigation than the police are providing. Things are in turmoil in London as Germany and England are preparing to go to war yet again. As long time readers know, the series started at the end of WWI where Maisie had served as a combat nurse in France. Now war is back in the picture.
As Maisie's investigation progresses, she discovers more refugees being murdered and moves fast to try and stop them. Personally her home in the country is being turned into a haven for children escaping from London and potential bombing. She involves her father and stepmother in this and it is good to catch up with them. One little girl won't speak and she must unravel the mystery of who the child is as no one knows her. On top of all this Billy is having problems at home, Sandra is pregnant and Priscilla is naturally worried about her boys and the war. Maisie's plate is definitely full.
I first started reading this series in 2003 when the first book came out. It was great as it was two books in one. I have been a faithful reader since and really liked the series. There was a spot when the series ran out of gas but this one is quite high quality. The mystery is quite interesting and I did not solve it. It's good to read about the wonderful supporting characters. I want to stress you can read this as a stand alone. The mystery is quite good and the depiction of the times is interesting. I had no idea that Londoners carried gas masks around before war was even declared. I had no idea that children were being shipped out before the bombing started. Still, if you are a fan of the series it's especially nice to see how Maisie has evolved. I can't wait to read what happens next.. (less)",Positif

Audiobook
This review is for books 1 & 2 (The Second Life of Nick Mason & Exit Strategy)
So far, this series is most certainly over-the-top.... but I don't care. I enjoyed these books.
Nick Mason definitely is not a good man.... but he isn't really a bad man either. He's in a tough situation and is doing the best he can to protect the ones he loves. I liked this premise and I liked that the author didn't take the *safe* path when writing this. He took chances and made Nick a gray-area hero. There is a lot of action, a little bit of romance, testing of friendships, and love of family. This is not a perfectly written book and I'm sure some could find fault in the story or things to criticize, but I enjoyed the ride.
I look forward to the third book coming out in 2019. I will definitely read more by this author. (less)",Positif

,"Young Adult, Fantasy, Paranormal",Fiona,"Another strong entry in this series. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's not a series where you can jump right in from the second, but this is not one of those second books.
While it can't stand alone, it's also not just a bridge between ""the interesting things happening in book one"" that hypes us up for ""the interesting things that will happen in book three"". There's plenty of story here and even some resolution.
It's still pretty grim - if you have young adults reading this it's worth noting that we are still occasionally dealing with traumatised juvenile murder victims, and not just murder but torture and/or forcible mind control. It's not as explicit this time around but the references are there. And honestly - it's like that moment in The Incredibles for me. These are bad guys, who won't go easy on them because they're children. They will use them, or they will discard them, and that means death is absolutely on the table. It's real stakes that actually ring true.
I'm definitely looking forward to the next book, and thank you to the publishers and Netgalley for a review copy of this one. (less)",Positif

,"Young Adult, Contemporary, Romance, Fiction ",chloe â™¡,"I received a review copy of Eight Days on Planet Earth from YA Bound Book Tours through Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review :D
Storytime:
I remember signing up for this blog tour back in August? September? I can't remember, lol. The book cover's really pretty and that's the reason why I signed up. Oh my goodness I'm so shallow. (But I'm pretty sure non-book-cover-judgers are an extinct species.)
Then a few days ago I received an email from Edelweiss - my request got approved! I planned to download it when I got home, but I forgot #whoops THEN THE NEXT DAY I GOT ANOTHER EMAIL FROM EDELWEISS, SAYING THAT MY REQUEST HAS BEEN DENIED??? I was super confused. My request got approved the day before, but I couldn't access it.
After that I sent an email to the blog tour organizer. I was so frustrated because I didn't know how to type a professional email. I slammed down on my keyboard, typing ""HELP MEEEE"". Actually, I was planning to delete the ""HELP MEEE"" part after I calmed down, but then my classmate pressed the ""send"" button before I deleted it! I was so angry ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Moral of the story: Don't let your classmate touch your laptop.
Book thoughts:
That cover is an effing masterpiece. I love the dark purplish starry background and the silhouettes! Also how cute is that curly brush font? ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
Now let's talk about the content of the book, shall we?
Eight Days on Planet Earth is a book about love, stargazing and outer space. Aaaaahh. My Love from the Star feels.
(Actually, no. I haven't watched that K-Drama. My sister binge watched it last month and finished it in a few days. But I don't think it's something I would love. Soo yeahhhh I still haven't watched it.)
I found it so cool that Matty lives next to a field. And it's not just a normal field - but a space field! Rumor has it a spaceship crashed there. Matty used to do a lot of stargazing and it's really interesting to read about. I don't know much about telescopes and stargazing (I joined Astronomy Club this year because my friends asked me to) and I learnt a lot reading about it. My school's Astronomy Club will be organizing a stargazing camp soon, and I am really looking forward to going!
I believe in aliens. Surely we're not the only ones living in this great big universe!
She found solace in the knowledge that we are not alone in the Universe.
I love Priya so much. She's so beautiful and pure and aaaahh I love how she writes notes about life on earth in a notebook! She has a very unique style - white wig + tutu and she is so weird in a very nice way! At the end, it wasn't really revealed if she's really an alien or just a patient with terminal illness though, and ughh it left me wanting more! (That's exactly how I felt when reading We Were Liars - I didn't know if Cadence went mad or if she's dead. I hate it when authors don't tell me all the details! I have no idea what to think lol.)
I'm not sure if I like the romance between Matty and Priya. I mean, Priya seems clueless. I don't think she knows what a kiss is for. Okay, Matty's the one who told her what a kiss is, and that it means you love someone, but Priya still seems kind of confused. She kisses Matty because she likes the feeling. I'm not sure if it really means she loves him back. Also it has been eight days only and they've already had sex??? And the biggest problem is - Matty doesn't think that having sex with an alien is 1. weird and 2. can bring potential danger to humankind. They are really sweet and all, but I think the whole thing's kind of rushed (which I totally understand. If you name the book Three Hundred Days on Planet Earth it doesn't really sound that good.)
This is such a great book. I recommend it to fans of contemporary romance and anything space-related. It's magical. It's sad. It's beautiful. You'll love it. (less)",Positif

I liked this one fine. But it didn't wow me.
A few things bugged me that kept me from rating this one higher:
--Zach's inner thoughts regarding his denial that he was gay got a little old the first half of the book.
--Harper got off WAY too easy. He was just as big of a dick as Cobb.
BUT.....
--VIRGIN sex. Always a plus there.
--Zach DID step up when it counted.
So yeah, I liked it. But I didn't love it. I am intrigued by Apollo though and....age gap. So I'll definitely be giving that one a go.

So guys this was one of my favourite series but this book just made me so upset. I hate it!!!! I feel to laugh in Mare's face at the end. Bitch. I am so happy that that happened! I think that's one of the only positives. Oh and these are just my taught and opinions ;)
So I finally decided to do a proper review.
I gave this book 2*. I won't lie the first half was enjoyable. The sarcasm was on point and I loved the whole weird feelings and relationship between Mare and Maven. It was interesting and reminded me so much of Unravel Me that it just broke my heart.
The whole plot with Cameron and Cal and crew was just a yawn fest for me.
However I finally realised what people mean about Mare. My eyes was finally open to see how she is a self centered bitch. Everything must revolve around her or else she will find a way for the plot to become so. For example Maven stayed away from Mare for like about a month and because she was bored and felt as if he was not paying her any attention she made it her duty to get his attention. Its ridiculous. Why does the author goad on readers in a certain direction and just totally do the opposite by the end of the book? Why give me hope? I can understand if you don't fool readers and tell them about one thing but then and stick with that. Then there is no reason to get angry. But when you make me feel one way and then just snatch it away???? Just for fan reaction I get angry and pissed.
Anyway so the plot pretty much was non existent. You can skip this one really and go on to book 4.
Surprisingly I liked Cal better in this book than the last. I totally understand why he did what he did. Once again Mare cough*ass* tries to make him feel bad. Cal is so much more than the author makes him out to be. He reminds ma a bit of Chaol though.
I just have a bad feeling that Maven will die in the next book. I hope not. I really do. At this point I can just read an entire book from his perspective. My heart broke for him in this book. Such a strong character. I feel so sorry for him. Why can't Maven just be happy and get a good ending? Is it too much to ask????? Maven is a character who needs time and his character needs to be fleshed out properly so that he can be understood and not misread.Come on Victoria. You can do better. (view spoiler) Gonna say this now: if book 4 turns out the way i hope then i will totally try to look pass the sheer stupidity of this one. Anyway let me stop my rambling for now. May or may not read the last book.
Edit.
For the Mare & Maven shippers
(view spoiler)
Edit (taught before reading)
my link text. Guys the books trailer!!!!!!Maven!!!!!!Aggggggggghhhhhbfhskkd
Lets remind ourselves of how sexy Maven is!
The shadow of the flame. He is certainly ablaze, but darkness eats at his edges. Bruise-like splotches of black and blue surround eyes bloodshot with silver veins. He has not slept. Heâ€™s thinner than I remember, leaner, crueler. His hair, black as a void, has reached his ears, curling at the ends, and his cheeks are still smooth.
Maven!!!
Edit
Guys! Tomorrow!!! Despite what happens that's that. I am going into it with low expectations, because when I go in in the highs everything is just awful if I expect too much and that has happened a lot especially with Throne of Glass series for me. Good luck everyone!
I need the time to sapped up to Feb 7th! I don't think I can wait any longer! The suspense is killing me!!!!!
Update
A snippet
Knowing it's what he wants to see, I let the tears of frustration overwhelm and fall. He tracks their paths with hunger
I know Maven still has feelings for Mare.
Edit
It has a cover!!!! And its a crown made of BONES!!!!!
A bag of mysteries, this book!!!

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Christian Fiction, Romance, Christian, Fiction",Olivia,"While the first few chapters were a bit slow to get into, I thought the book was gentle, sweet, and full of many emotions. The author moves the story at a slow pace, revealing the beauty of the untrod American countryside as well as the rawness of the open country ravaged by Indians intent on keeping their land. The mentions of the Boones were some of my favorite parts :)
Some might find this too emotional, but honestly I thought it was beautiful. The spiritual message was profound and played a great part into the story. Nate's love of Scripture made me happy. Sion and Tempe's slowly blooming love was realistic and deep.
Content wise there were a couple kissing scenes, one particular scene of bathing in the river might be a bit awkward to some readers, and a few vague mentions of womanly things. There is also violence and mention of scalpings.
The moonbow was shattering-mere bits of color in the blackness, a sort of bridge between heaven and earth-reminding her that even on the darkest nights were was a glimmer of hope, of promise, however hazy.

,"Horror, Historical, Historical Fiction, Gothic, Fiction, Mystery, Fantasy, Paranormal",Holly B,"The Silent Companions is a gothic, foreboding, spooky ghost story. It is very well written and I especially enjoyed the setting of the crumbling mansion (named The Bridge) in England. The story alternates between events of 1635 to the present day of 1865.
It begins with Elsie in an asylum, with a creepy attendant and a young doctor who exclaims, â€œI am here to decide your fate.â€ He wasnâ€™t joking.
The history of the house is told and it is a strange one. It was left empty during and after the Civil War, until family started to return, but no one stayed for very long. Were skeletons buried under the house?
When Elsie moves back into the house, she begins to â€œexperienceâ€ it. She describes her bed as â€œcold and sinisterâ€, she finds mysterious items, hears hissing in the night, walks on a wobbling staircase and the house seems to be â€œwatching herâ€ along with the lurking servants.
Just who is going mad here?

,"Historical, Historical fiction, Fiction, Historical, Adult Fiction",Diane S â˜”,"What an intensely emotional and powerful book. The latter part of the eighteen hundreds, options are few for unmarried women in the family way. This is the condition in which Lillie a Quaker, finds herself. Though educated to be a teacher, Quaker woman did receive an education, she finds herself alone and with resources.Her mother has died, her brother and fiancÃ©e gone away trying to make some money, promising to send for her when they are able, her father remarried and booted out of church, she is forced to turn to a home for pregnant women. This is actually a better place then many, but they are fighting for resources and are unable to provide much help after delivery. Most women are forced to give up their child but Lilli cannot.
Lilli goes from circumstance to circumstance, each one bleaker than the one before. These women were so looked down on, often forced into prostitution or suicide, not able to find any type of normal, sustainable employment. Considered unclean, sinners, beneath consideration. Heartbreaking and we travel along with her, the writing, the atmosphere so detailed. Can't help but admire her fortitude, her drive to survive and find away for her and her child. A few people offered small kindnesses that kept her going, but I literally has to put this down at times, I became so emotionally invested in her quest. Angry too, that women were treated like this. The unfairness, the hypocrisy. I won't tell you how this turns out, will just have to read it for yourselves, it is well worth the read.
Author's note furnished at the back of the books is also very well done, explaining the situations and trials unmarried, pregnant women went through, what places in the novel were real and other interesting details.

,"Mystery, Fiction, Crime, Thriller, Mystery Thriller",Monnie,"New character and series? Base hit. By a favorite author? Double play. Getting a copy from the publisher to read in exchange for an honest review? Bases loaded.
The new character is Renee Ballard, a relatively young and feisty detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. The author is Michael Connelly, well known and much loved by me for his Harry Bosch and Lincoln Lawyer (Mickey Haller) series. And my honest opinion? A home run!
Also in all honesty, though, neither Harry nor Mickey need worry; this mama still loves them best. But when someone new comes along that's worthy of note, there's plenty of room left on my virtual bookshelves. And that means the next time Renee Ballard makes an appearance, I'll be there to greet her.
A native of Hawaii with a journalism degree from the University of Hawaii, Ballard spends part of her free time riding the California surf with her faithful dog Lola. She's also fighting a few demons from the past, including the untimely death of her beloved father in a water-related accident and the fact that her long-time day shift partner failed to support her in her sexual harassment claim against her supervisor. As a result of that unsuccessful complaint, she's been relegated to the night shift - a.k.a. the Late Show. Now, she and her new partner, John Jenkins, are charged with investigating crimes that happen in the wee hours, but they must turn all their findings over to an appropriate ""desk"" rather than follow up on their own.
It's not always easy to let go of cases that come her way, but she manages - until, that is, she doesn't. On a single night, she lands in the middle of two: The first is the brutal beating of a prostitute who ends up close to death in an induced coma at the hospital. The second involves the murder of several patrons and a female employee at a local nightclub. She pleads her case for continuance on both cases, winning the right to follow up on the prostitute's. On the murders, though, everyone from the top down, including her partner, insists that she back off - but she's not having any of it. Bringing her extensive investigative skills and instincts to bear, she deals the beating incident during work hours. Then, using off hours and spare time, she delves into the nightclub murders with equal gusto - and lands smack dab in the middle of a close-to-home ""hit"" and a complex case that not only threatens her own future, but that of the entire department.
Now, of course, I'm looking forward to Ballard's next assignment. Bring her on!

,"Romance, Dark, New Adult, Contemporary",S.M. West,"I was beyond thrilled when I learned that we were getting a story about the offspring from my two favourite series - TAT and DA - from this author!
TAT was my first read of Karina's and I feel in love with her. So, visiting Ellie and Camden, as well Javier - YES!!
And of course, Vicente and Violet were amazing! This story sucked me right in and never let go. With Vicente, Karina gave us just enough of Javi to love son like father, but also made him his own man. And damn, he was dark and sexy.
Violet on the other hand is made to believe she's too sensitive and can't handle a lot, but she's made of harder stuff. After all, she's the daughter of Ellie and Camden!
This is a raw, sexy and dangerous read with some dark moments. V & V together were hot.
I had a hunch about where things might be going and it paid off, but even with that I loved the way this story took you on a labyrinth of lies, deceit, sex, love and betrayal. I can't wait for the next book in this Duet. I want it now!

*****5 STARS!!*****
4 years later...
Omggggggg how I've missed these two men. I mean, they will always be one of my favorite couples in ALL of the romance genres, but revisiting them again after all this time was the best gift EVER!! I read EVERY word, no skimming because WHO WOULD DO THAT?! Like seriously, if you don't soak up every word of this book, I question your sanity because hello, it's Logan and Tate!
We started this journey with Logan and Tate four years ago, when they first crossed paths and broke through barriers to start a beautiful journey together, I also joined on this journey with them as a reader. So it's kind of crazy that Tease takes place literally four years after the first book was released.
With both Logan and Tate's careers at their peak, they're feeling pulled too much in the wrong direction. Realizing how hard it is to make their relationship a priority, they make strides to rectify this immediately! It's hilarious how after all this time that Logan is still surprised at the fact that Tate knows him so well, like he's shocked that he's still in a committed relationship. His insecurities still linger just below the surface and Tate handles him SO well. They really are perfect for each other, like when bossy Tate comes out it makes Logan crazy(in the best way!) and I just ADORE how balanced they make each other!
Omg can this woman write a sex scene or what?! Talk about the best slow burning, sensual, sexy as hell, hot and bothered thing you will read between two people! The pure carnal desire that these two have for each other is like some sublime force that will never die and never get old. Never. Ever. Tate with his silky curls and Logan and his smart mouth, and their sexy banter filled with sexual innuendos and puns. NEVER. GETS. OLD.
All of the characters you know and love are back, along with some we don't love so much, and some newbies too! We get to really see who they are today and how they've grown and evolved, and how that intertwines with Logan and Tate's life present day. One of these moments was extremely emotional for me and that just proves what the power of a fictional story can do for a very real life, I was surprisingly moved by a certain scene and I found it to be very therapeutic for me personally. And I think with this book specifically, that will happen for a lot of readers for several different reasons. That's why I love books so much, because reconnecting with these characters feels just like coming home.
When Ella Frank announced that we were getting THREE more books in the Temptation series, I just about had a heart attack, and I cried tears of joy, like legitimate tears running down my face. Tease was done SO well, and in my opinion, was a great beginning of a continuation-story that promises to be a great ride! I'm beyond excited to see what the next book in the series has to offer us lucky readers. So thank you Ella, for taking me back to my happy place with Logan and Tate, it was such a warm comfy place to be (and totally hot too). True fans of these guys will absolutely devour this book, and you should because it's AMAZING and wonderful and ALL the adjectives. (less)",Positif

THIS BOOK!!! It's everything and THEN SOME!!! An absolute must read! And it's on my TOP 17 OF 17 List! Watch out for Meagan Brandy book world!!! She's gonna knock you on your ASS! Loved loved loved this story!!!
My heart has been COMPLETELY and UTTERLY consumed by this story. From the moment I opened my kindle, I was a goner. Kalani is one of my most favourite heroines EVER. Sheâ€™s real, sheâ€™s sassy, she tells it like it is and doesnâ€™t fuck around. And the minute her and Nate came together, I felt the sparks and magic between them. I was one hundred percent engulfed by their chemistry.
Nate. Holy Jesus. His cockiness set my loins on fire. His sweet, sexy, dirty words to Kalani seared my soul. Iâ€™m not joking. God. Iâ€™m so in love with him. He helped her so much, I could cry just thinking about it. Iâ€™d melt into a puddle of lust and feels every damn time heâ€™d say â€œKalaniâ€. I shit you not I could HEAR his rough, sexy voice saying her name.
The side characters. CHRIST! I loved their friends and my god his family!!! I want to be adopted by his mom and dad. There were so many fun and special moments I have a smile so huge right now just thinking about some of the scenes between all of these characters. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever highlighted a book so much.
What I love about the story is how much it made me FEEL. Fumbled Hearts made my HEART do all the things. It swelled, shattered and ached. There were many moments that had me swooning hard. There were moments I cried. And let me tell you there definitely scenes that made me want to throw my damn kindle. HARD. I was so pissed and upset for these characters in certain scenes that I felt sick and I was literally shaking. Because I was so attached and consumed by Nate and Kalani, I felt like I was feeling everything they were. Experiencing their happiness, pain and hell to the YES their pleasure. That says something. Meagan Brandy did all these things to me with her beautiful, emotional and captivating story telling.
If youâ€™re looking for a sexy, fun and emotional new adult romance that will fumble your heart in all the best ways possible, then take a chance on this debut author. Swear to god I felt ALL of the EVERYTHINGS! Iâ€™m still feeling them! What am I going to do with my life now? Time for a re-read!

I'm throwing in the towel. I can't continue any more which is making me sad because I never DNF. I somewhat enjoyed the first book. Yes, I struggled with Crown of Lies but the story picked up. With Throne of Truth it just keeps dragging on and on. Whenever something is about to happen it gets derailed constantly with stupid excuses just to further the story. I was bored and I also early on figured out who Nameless was. Now I only needed to know Penn's backstory and then it was too late. I wasn't committed to the story or its characters. I know it's fiction but certain things like the criminal law justice and how a chief police captain can cheat the system was too far fetched and ridiculous.
I've enjoyed other books by Pepper Winters. I love the Indebted and Monsters in The Dark series and this little hiccup won't stop me from reading her books.

,"Fantasy, Urban Fantasy, Paranormal, Fiction",Wanda,"A fabulous Friday night read. A glass of wine and another volume of InCryptid.
In this installment, we get to know the youngest Price, Antimony (Annie), as she gets drafted into the familyâ€™s plans. Her carnival and roller derby past will serve her in good-stead as she attempts to infiltrate the Covenant of St. George.
We learn more about the Covenant and Price family dynamics, plus McGuire manages to neatly tie in her ghost characters, previously explored in Sparrow Hill Road. For me, the best part was Annieâ€™s companion Aeslin mouse, Mindy, who makes contact with the Aeslin who remained in the U.K. I love her new companion, Mork, who joins Annie & Mindy to serve & protect cryptids. McGuire is obviously old enough to have seen & enjoyed Robin Williamsâ€™ first TV show, Mork & Mindy, which I hadnâ€™t thought of in years.
As per usual, the mice make the book for me. I adore them and Iâ€™m not sure I would love the books the way I do without the magical mice.

I enjoyed the beginning and middle where we learn about Aliceâ€™s childhood. Learning about her self discovery in college and her love of French food drew me in. This book also made me appreciate how different things are for women these days. There is still sexism but Alice opened a restaurant during a time when female business owners were an anomaly. Alice definitely communicates a passion for food as an experience and not just sustenance that is alluring and contagious to the reader.
A lot of her recounting of her past relationships and interactions with key players in the counter culture movement seemed almost idealized. Perhaps Iâ€™m cynical but she seemed to retain almost a naÃ¯vetÃ© about how â€œgreat it all was.â€

,"Fiction, War, Cultural, Iran, Contemporary, Realistic Fiction",Ingrid Contreras,"Sometimes we turn to fiction for the things we donâ€™t understand. My favorite novels are about a lunatic, a pedophile, twins with an incestuous relationshipâ€”Don Quixote, Lolita, The God of Small Things, respectively. These books have brought me to the shores of the unforeseen and the unexplainable. Looking at things from the other side of the mirror has value; this is what weâ€™re after when we read fictionâ€”we want to be taken far away, and we want to return, with something new to show.
The third in a trilogy following three generations of Kurdish-Iranian men as they leave their homeland and take on new identities, Laleh Khadiviâ€™s A Good Country gets at our most modern interrogationâ€”what is the path to terrorism, how does it unfold, and how is it possible?
If youâ€™ve ever wondered about these questions, this is the book for you. An unblinking coming-of-age portrait of an American-islamist radical recruit, A Good Country is a heartbreaking story you won't soon forget.
â€œThis was high school,â€ Laleh Khadivi writes. â€œYou started out as one thing and ended as something else.â€ In A Good Country, Khadivi explores teenagedom as a phase of combustion in this story of a young Iranian-American boyâ€™s radicalization. Born in an affluent community in Orange County, Reza Courdee goes from model immigrant, to stoner, to a boy shunned by his friends and targeted for his skin in the wake of a terrorist event, to a young man searching for what is right and wrong, true and false. In this search, he chooses a path which happens to be a false promise.
It is hard to imagine, at the book's onset, how Khadivi will get from one end of the social spectrum to the other -- from the inconsequential pressures of a sunny high school and prospects of Bay Area Ivy Leagues to war-torn Syria, where Rezâ€™s boundless dreaming bottoms out as he realizes heâ€™s signed up to join a radical Islamist militant group, and that the new country promised, the great utopia, does not exist.
Somehow we get there, and itâ€™s because Khadivi is a magician. Written, I would say, with a scalpel, Khadivi is equal parts teenage-boy whisperer and magic-ball seer. The book opens:
They told him it was the best, there was nothing better. After they started, at twelve and thirteen and fourteen, his friends tried to convince him to try it. Rez, dude, theyâ€™d say, itâ€™s no big deal. You donâ€™t puke. You donâ€™t pass out. No one can even tell. Itâ€™s like daydreaming, like that second just before you fall asleep, but for hours, they said, for the whole of eighth grade, their eyes glazed with the shine of the newly converted, and by tenth grade they gave up, and now, start of junior year, it was habit to make fun of him every time there was occasion, every time they circled up to light and puff and smoke, these friends.
In the background of this book, between the lines, Khadivi seems to be asking: what is a good country? Is it the America of Rezâ€™s father, which Rez disrespects by getting a B in History? Is it his white friend Kellyâ€™s America, of â€œthe network of invisible sewers gushing under everything and the fair laws over them all, good police who donâ€™t fuck with you for no reasonâ€?
It is not the America, Rez concludes, that turns on skin color after a terrorist attack, where a man at a car casually walks by and spits on his fatherâ€™s shoe. It is not America â€œthe pressure cooker.â€ It is certainly not Mexico, whose decorative skeletons and poverty â€œfreak him out.â€ At times Rez believes it might be the ocean, where he surfs, where â€œthe water turned the same navy as the sky and when Rez paddled out far from the breaks to take a rest, the water grew still and he saw little flecks of stars in the ocean, their shimmer mixed with the easy rolls and laps of the sea. Sandwiched, he thought, folded in, a galaxy above, a galaxy below.â€
Those who study recent history know that in 2014 ISIL claimed the city of Raqqah as the Caliphate, the capital of the Muslim state. It was supposed to be the return of a great Muslim capital, a new state built from the ground up, land reclaimed, a place where Muslims could finally have brotherhood and be in peace. The ISIL propaganda attracted a wide range of Muslims, who flew to Raqqah to be part of the birth of the new city, but it was always an empty promise built on genocide. We may imagine Rez as one of the foreigners who flew to Raqqah looking for such a sense of place.
A good country, Khadivi seems to argue in this complex, hypnotizing novel, is a state of belonging. Wherever that feeling is missing, thatâ€™s where a good country fails. (less)",Positif
,"Fantasy, Urban Fantasy, Paranormal, Fiction",â˜• Kimberly,"After the mind-blowing ending of Chaos Chronography, Antimony, the youngest Price sister, who incidentally looks nothing like her siblings, is tasked with traveling to London to infiltrate the Covenant! Can she convince them of her cover story? Can she and one lone Aslin mouse discover what the Covenant knows about the Price family and if they are planning an all-out war? Eeep!
McGuire hooked me from the beginning as narrator Emily Bauer took on new voices and new creatures. Antimony (Annie) is twenty-two and a roller-derby loving young woman who is still living at home. She hasn't quite decided what she wants to do in life but throughout Magic for Nothing, we witness her come into her own, through growth and sacrifice.
Being inside the Covenant of St. George was just as creepy as I hoped. From their thorough investigation and testing of Annie, we learn quite a lot. She has one lone Aslin mouse with her. Wait until you see what this young mouse uncovers, aside from a full inventory of their cheese.
Thanks to Annie's unusual skill set with knife throwing and trapeze work the Covenant sends Annie back to America to infiltrate and spy on a traveling circus. Here things get interesting and deadly. As always, McGuire delivers an intense suspense thread while fleshing out new characters and showcases different types of cryptids. Explosions, death-defying tricks and Covenant operatives await you.
The books typically have a romantic thread and Annie develops feelings for one of the performers. Holy Weirdness peeps! Now ya'll know her extended family is filled with cryptids, ghosts, talking mice and more, but most of the Price family are married to HUMANS.

An enjoyable read, albeit a heavy one. I thought the POVs from the four female MCs (Alice, Zoe, Kate & Sonja) worked well & the story flowed fairly easily. While I didn't have any particularly strong feelings for any of these characters, I didn't abhor them & could feel their pain as they each deal with the upheaval in their lives. From my own standpoint, I could certainly relate to Zoe with her super tight bond with her mother & social anxiety. With this, it hits a bit too close to home & I guess that's where my problem comes from.
To be clear, I don't have a problem with how Hepworth wrote Zoe (to an extent). I thought she did an exemplary job of portraying the daily struggle of dealing with this debilitating disorder & reassuring that ""we are not all the same"", etc. so it's not like Zoe's story is a clear cut path to overcoming anxiety. I appreciated this, but it doesn't change the feelings I had reading the last two thirds of the book. In simplistic terms, she overcomes her anxiety with ease- so much ease that regardless of her understandable struggle (especially with her mother's health declining), everything happens a bit too fast for her to suddenly be ""okay""/coming to terms with acceptance. I'm not saying it's so unrealistic that it's a damaging image or that some cases really can be changed that easily, but to me it felt like something shoved aside when Alice's future is revealed. I just wish it would have stayed a constant throughout, (perhaps she wouldn't have gotten all the answers)- but I realize fictionalized stories are not reality & besides suspending a bit of disbelief, I don't have any brazen negative feelings towards this.
I also feel that this was wrapped up too fast & too neat. I won't say too much because spoilers, but I think Alice's character arc was handled too rapidly, while Sonja's & Kate's were not as drawn out as I would have liked. As stated I felt Zoe's was mishandled & the last several chapters really burned out. To go through all that drama & tears, I am so let down by the end. I think I would have liked this more if there weren't so many answers- but then again, it provides a positive outlook for such an awful situation. So with that, I'm torn. I've certainly read worse, but I don't think this will be something I'll come back to again. Overall, I DID like this & Hepworth's prose keeps you glued to the page, but I'd recommend her THINGS WE KEEP if you're looking for a good place to start. (less)",Positif

""The damned souls who together found grace.""
I think it is almost impossible for me to rate any book in this series below a 4.5 stars. Tillie Cole has created such an intricate and haunting world with characters who are so complicated. All of them are looking for a light in the darkness that is their life. I was looking forward to AK's story, because he intrigued me a lot. I wanted to know about his background, and what happened to make him join the Hades Hangmen. As always you can expect some very dark and horrific events happening in this book. Tillie is such a phenomenal author, and she shows it again in this book. Like in each book the story isn't only about the main two characters but also about the whole Hades Hangmen community. You'll be reunited with your favorite characters and see how they are doing. She continues to develop the main characters of the previous books, which is beautiful and also heartbreaking sometimes. Especially my favorite Hangmen Flame goes through huge changes. I love him so much.
""He was a shining beacon of hope. The only face the made me feel safe. Because there was a darkness in him too, a fellow traveler on the same uneasy road.""
Phebe and AK were perfect for each other. Both of them have a very traumatic past, and especially the flashbacks were heartbreaking. This book/series is not for the faint of heart. There is a new bad guy in town, and boy do they do some disgusting and inhumane things. There were scenes that were really hard to read and I had to remind myself that this is just a book. I am not going into the plot because the synopsis is pretty detailed about what to expect. Tillie did an amazing job in showing how someone even though you get them out of traumatizing event, they are still haunted by demons. The character development and fallback was done phenomenally. I wouldn't change anything about this book. AK and Phebe not only saved each other but also showed that ""for every dark night, there is a brighter day."" (Quote by Tupac Shakur) Sorry for the vague review, but like I mentioned I don't think you need any more information than you get from the blurb.

Honestly, I could read stories like this all day every day and never tire of them. I know some romance readers don't like revisiting established couples over and over, especially when the plot - like this one - simply follows the couple in their day-to-day lives, with little angst or drama to drive the story forward, but for me, this is when I'm in my zone!
I found this 4th installment of the Temptation series absolutely perfect in its simplicity.
The story just follows Logan and Tate through their daily lives, four years after the original trilogy takes place. It was great to see them thriving in their relationship and in their professional lives.
They've still got it, too. Boy, do they ever! Their chemistry is still burning hot and their love is so well-established that diving into this story was like putting on my favourite comfy sweater - it just fit and felt amazing.
It was also great to revisit some of the other much loved secondary characters, including Robbie, who stole a lot of the spotlight for me and who now needs to get his own spin-off, pretty please with a cherry on top!!! Plus, Cole and Rachel's children were damn cute, too, and I look forward to seeing more interactions between them and ""Unca"" Tate and Uncle Logan.

When classmates asked ""so what else are you?"" Lily, as coached by her mom, lied and replied ""Italian."" Don't tell anyone you are Iranian!
Born and reared in Tehran but shipped to San Fransisco at age 18 by her father, Noor has turned her back on her home country. She deeply loves her father, the sweet restauranteur Zod, but has not been back in 30 years - at his insistance.
As the story opens in California, Noor is the centerpiece of a generational tale that gradually introduces four generations of loving, generous people. I was a bit worried that this would be fairly standard chick lit trope - heartbroken-woman-with-irascible-teenager-finally-develops-a-backbone-and-finds-happiness. The first chapters tasted a bit like your basic Lifetime movie but with pomegranate soup, kabobs, and lots of recipes on the sideboard.
When circumstances persuade Noor to do something unexpected with her life, she books plane tickets to take Lily to Tehran to finally meet her grandfather. When the story arrives in Iran, teenaged Lily is still smart-mouthed and sullen. Noor is still timid...but, oh! We get to meet Zod!
Zod's parents were Russian refugees - his mother an incredible cook - who escaped the revolution by emigrating to Iran. Tehran in those days had streets full of music and culture, food and dancing. Travel to and from the country was unfettered, and Zod was sent abroad to study in Paris. When he returned for a family funeral and for his own wedding to his heart's delight, the story truly sang.
Let me spare you a play-by-play of what went on during Tehran's revolution, but suffice it to say that the uber religious seized power. Women who had been sunbathing in bikinis just months prior were now required to be covered head to toe while in public. No more music in the streets. No more rights for women. It seems insane to think that a gentle and devoted father would ship his children across the world and demand that they never return. Yet when we read of the terrors to women, we begin to understand Zod in a way his daughter cannot. She has not seen what we readers have.
The tail end of the story has an aftertaste of that Lifetime movie aforementioned, but not in a bad way. Recipes and food preparation are presented throughout the book for us to sample. Teenaged Lily is dangerously and naiively brazen in a country that kills for far less. And Noor still procrastinates upon making decisions and declarations. But Zod is there, preparing sweet dough in our dreams and calling the name of his wife every night in his own sleep.

4 Stars - Thoughtful, delightful cute and very tenderly sweet told daddy kink romance
Call Me Daddy is a sizzling erotic romance even with this strange, in my mind kind of odd and hard to understand (but also in some ways not), lifestyle. This is close to and to start with close to a dangerously near a no no topic. ...But it actually hooked me from first page. Surprised and a bit stunned.
**********************************************
Call Me Daddy could maybe be described as when ""a young innocent Pink Babe Princess needs a win-win in a rescuing older Manly Prince with a fatherly style, and gets him"". No fuss about both a big age difference and strong preferences for full ""daddy"" kink, but surprisingly romantic, safe and tenderly sweet. Beautifully told from the first page. Like being in a sugar-soft erotica cloud...
The heroine is the college student Laine Seabourne. A 18 years old girl who one night is rescued by an older good looking man. â€” Nick Lynch (...later called 'Daddy Nick') is a 42 years quite lonely buisness man. A man with a since long ago tragic loss.
Nick need someone to cuddle, to protect, to take care for and care about. Laine on the other side needs to be cared about. She is a girl from a broken home who's longing for love, tender thoughts, a nice home, a strong father figure and to be someone's nice ""little girl"". â€” We have a perfect match.
â€The Maculinea Arion is the largest and rarest of the blue English butterflies. Little, blue-eyed Laine reminds me of one â€“ so beautiful in her fragility. So graceful and delicate. Such a rare delight. I tell her so, and her smile melts my heart.â€
**********************************************
Wow, you never knew what you will be reading next
To be honest this basic storyline and topic is a bit out of my normal (prude) comfort zone. I'm surprised to say I actually enjoyed reading this one a lot. Not even any cringing or eye rolling. â€” Call Me Daddy will for sure raise questions about forbidden issues (...dark thoughts), but here it is so nice and tenderly told. â€” Two (nearly grownup) people gets what they sincerely want and it ends with the feel of dreamy smex, kink and a romantic saga.
Sincerely glad I dared to try. One time is maybe enough for me with the daddy-topic but this book, and it's tenderly nice storline written by Jade West, was a very good romance. Will not leave my head and heart for a while. â€” Recommended in the kink erotic genre. :)

So I haven't read Karina Halle's Artist's Trilogy and Dirty Angels Series (which I understand Black Hearts is a spin off of). But after reading Black Hearts this is what I've gathered:
1. Vincente is the son of Javier - who runs a drug cartel in Mexico - and is next in line to take over. Vincente and Javier don't really get along and Vincente wants to separate himself from his father and his ways. He wants to be free to run the cartel as he pleases.

3. Vincente sets out to find Ellie once he discovers her past relationship with his father as a way to gain information and an advantage over him. This is when he meets Violet and is immediately attracted to her. He knows she can't know who he really is. He knows he should stay away from her. But as hard as he tries (and okay he doesn't try THAT hard) he just can't resist.
4. Vincente and Violet begin to date, even though she has no idea who he truly is, or how he's connected to her parents.
5. Vincente and Violet have a lot of hot sex.
6. Vincente is fucking delicious and I must have something seriously wrong with me because all I kept wishing while I was reading this was that some drug cartel prince would come and corrupt me.
""I want to ravage her, fuck her, screw her, keep doing this until all these feelings go away.
I'm angry. I'm so fucking angry that my heart feels something for her.
That she's getting under my skin.
That she's making me question who I am.""
7. Vincente can get it. (Sorry had to throw that in there). Really though. That boy is YUM. And for those who don't know what ""he can get it"" means, let me clarify. It means I'd very much like for Vincente to put his hands ALL UP ON ME.
""I want to devour her until there's nothing left. I want to make her scream and squirm and moan into oblivion. I want to be all there is for her.""
I really enjoyed this read. I was hooked from start to finish and I can't wait to see how this concludes! I'm hoping the next book has a bit of action and gore (this installment had very little). And of course, more Vincente doing very very bad and naughty things.
A few minor things that kept me from rating this 5 stars:
-I wish we got a little MORE background information on the past of the parents. Since their past is what set this whole plot in motion, I would have liked to have gotten more info on what caused the drama and why Javier is so hellbent on revenge and Ellie is so petrified of him, or even what Vincente's true motives are. I'm still not clear on that. I know this is tied to the Artists and Dirty Angels series but it IS being marketed as a standalone. I realize it's a risk to mention things that were already brought up in those other series and come across as repetitive to those who have already read them. But for a new reader, I feel like it would have been nice to have a little more insight on what went down. But maybe we'll get that info in the next book?
-I kind of wish Vincente wasn't claiming to be in love after only two weeks of knowing Violet. To me that just seems a little quick. In lust? Okay. In love? Nah. Too soon.
-There were a few minor spelling and grammatical errors but nothing too bad.
Overall, I REALLY liked this book, loved the writing, and can't wait for book 2!!!

,Romance,Christina,"Iâ€™m not sure what it is about second chances and friends to lovers, but they go together like peanut butter and jelly. They make me feel all the gooeyness that contemporary romance offers and it seems like these tropes might be the flavors du jour, which I have no problem with.
Quick recap: childhood friends-turned-lovers Frankie and Cole are ripped apart by consequence and reunite ten years later. Theyâ€™ve both moved on with their lives yet a piece of their hearts still live in the past. Frankieâ€™s life is turned upside down and Cole is there to catch her, but can they rekindle what they walked away from a decade earlier?
The storyline reads like a lot of many of the second chance/friends to lovers stories out there, it follows a bit of a formula, however it is the characters that make this stand out. I liked both Frankie and Cole from the beginning, and as I said earlier, I am a sucker for these plotlines. I was drawn in from the first page and the dual, first person POV gave both sides of the story, which I appreciated. I had a hard time putting it down and couldnâ€™t help but root for Frankie and Cole. Even with the predictability, it didnâ€™t make the story any less enjoyable.
This is my first read by this author and definitely not my last!

,"Fiction, Cultural, Australia ",Laura Anderson,"I almost abandoned this at about the 10% mark, before the multitude of 5 star reviews persuaded me to continue. I am kind of sorry that I did, though. It never really became anything. Nothing lived up to the potential. At no point did I feel like Heidl was this seductive, dangerous man who would get deep into your soul and was capable of swindling the banks out of millions. He was just an erratic pain in the ass. Then there's the main character, who was dull, incompetent and not a pleasant guy to spend so many pages with. I realise that's half the point, but the pacing meant I never really cared about him.
There were occasional flashes of brilliance, but for me they were single sentences or paragraphs every few dozen pages, rather than narrative brilliance.

Ohh guys, this beautiful book. It was everything I hoped for and more after falling in love with The Bear and the Nightingale earlier this year. It brings into sharp focus many things only hinted at in BEAR, and is packed with action, intrigue, and yes, even some R O M A N C E (I can't spoil the surprise but I must say, I'm a happy little toaster strudel).

The Delphi Resistance was a pretty interesting read. I love Anna and Aaron together but hot damn, I would be a hot mess with everyone inside my head. Heck, I could barely be inside my own head. After the ending of the first book, we see that Daniel is inside her head. He's also Aaron's brother which is completely heartbreaking because he doesn't know.
I was kind of hesitant about Aaron finding out but when he did.. Well, he took it a lot better than I thought he would. After that, Aaron, Anna, and the rest of their gang try to find kids with similar abilities or just an ability at all. Among the way, they meet the Cregg family.. and they are creepy as fuck. The Cregg family is also trying to find these unique kids because they want to hurt them.
Overall, it was such a good book that I honestly can't wait to dive into the next one.

Corinne Michaels brings the town of Bell Buckle, Tenn alive again with the story of Trent Hennington and Grace Morley. The last Hennington son to find love, except he's had his love for 20 years and has been afraid to give his heart completely.
This book tugs on all the feels. It's frustrating, it's sweet, it's tearful, its emotional and it's loving. Trent and Gracie have such a special relationship. They love each other but Trent won't commit and after 20 years, Grace decides that she has to move on. Maybe Trent isn't her Mr Right after all. Cooper Townsend, Trent's friend and her best friend's brother thinks he maybe her Mr. Right. But can Grace's heart really move on when she has given it to Trent? When Grace decides to give Cooper a chance, will it be the wake up call that Trent needs to see that the only woman he has only ever loved and who really gets him is really leaving him for good?
While trying to get Trent and Gracie on the same page, the whole gang is ever present and meddling. A small town is where everyone knows everybody's business. The whole gang adds a special warmth to the story that makes it even more sentimental and special.
I will say that this story is so much more than Trent finally seeing the light. There are pivotal moments that will trigger all your emotions. Be prepared to laugh, cry, get mad, get happy and to love. I will say that the direction the author took the story felt very real and genuine. To share with you would be to spoil the beautiful, frustrating, emotional story that is Say I'm Yours. I love Bell Buckle, the author's characters and her very sweet and and moving words.

,"Nonfiction, Politics, Autobiography, Memoir, Humor, Biography, Audiobook",Steven Z.,"In the current political climate with congressional hearings, a special prosecutor, and a chief executive who demands fealty as if he were a ""godfather"" it was good to read a political manifesto in the form of biography that with drips with sarcasm and humor. When one thinks of Al Franken, Saturday Night Live (SNL) comes to mind, and the â€œseriousâ€ laughter his writings, i.e., RUSH LIMBAUGH IS A BIG FAT IDIOT, and appearances produced. His new autobiography is in the same vein as he uses his life story as a clarion call for a progressive agenda and a fight against alternative news and/or reality and the lies that are perpetrated regularly by certain politicians and supposed news outlets.
AL FRANKEN: GIANT OF THE SENATE describes the evolution of a belief system that began at an early age, particularly as a young teen reacting to Lyndon Johnsonâ€™s work to get the 1964 Civil Rights Act signed into law. From that point on we witness Frankenâ€™s intellectual growth using his comedic sense through high school, college, a career on SNL, and a second career in the United States Senate. As Franken matures emotionally and politically his commitment to a progressive agenda for the American people (as well as Minnesota!) emerges. But make no mistake for Franken to be successful he had to suppress his public humor to avoid political pitfalls
The key event in his career was the death of Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone; his mentor, teacher, and intellectual role model. For Wellstone â€œpolitics was about improving peopleâ€™s lives.â€ Franken presents a wonderful chapter encompassing Wellstoneâ€™s lifeâ€™s work and positive goals for the American people. Franken explains the type of person he was and how he was influenced by his progressive agenda. Once Wellstone and his family are killed in a plane crash he was replaced in the Senate by Republican Norm Coleman who stated â€œI am a 99% improvement over Paul Wellstone.â€ For Al Franken it was â€œgame on.â€ Franken believed in Wellstoneâ€™s core, that â€œwe all do better, when we all do better,â€ a mantra that Franken has worked for since his time in the Senate.
Franken explores in detail his campaign against Norm Coleman. Faced with Republican obfuscation, distortion, and outright lies Franken was welcomed to the wonderful world of what he calls the â€œDehumorizer,â€ or how his opponent would do or say anything about his opponentâ€™s past and present be it fact or fiction, in the 2008 campaign, mostly fiction. Franken would defeat Coleman by 312 votes, but it took over eight months to finally join his Senate colleagues as Colemanâ€™s team dragged the results through the courts and in the end never really conceded. Fast forward, eight years later Franken was elected by a 10% margin. It is interesting how the Obama people did little to assist Franken, no matter what he did even Democrats could not wrap their heads around a former SNL comic becoming a serious politician.
The most interesting aspects of Frankenâ€™s story rests on the legislative process which is bound in hyprocracy by both major parties, though perhaps a bit more by Republicans. He cites a number of examples dealing with the 2009 Stimulus package which finally passed despite Republican opposition which led to a slower recovery than was necessary. This allowed Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell to blame the slow recovery on President Obama. This is the same Senator who stated once Obama was elected in 2009 that it was his primary purpose to make sure that the new president would not achieve any successes. It is also fascinating that certain congresspersons who voted against the stimulus took credit for it when it created benefits for their own districts.
Franken takes the reader behind the scenes as the Senate votes on legislation. In particular a â€œdisclosure billâ€ designed to offset the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United. The cavalier attitude of a number of Republicans is offered in their own words, of course funded by the Koch Brothers and their â€œFederalist agenda.â€ Franken goes on to eviscerate Texas Senator Ted Cruz in a chapter entitled â€œSophistry.â€ Franken is proud of the fact that he hates a colleague who in two short months managed to turn almost his entire party against him. As is Frankenâ€™s methodology throughout the book his comments are sardonic, humorous, and sarcastic, but below the surface the Senator from Minnesota is seething.
A major theme of the book is a clarion call for Democrats to turn out and remove Republicans from power. If it is not done soon, Franken argues President Trump will continue to dismantle the achievements that Obama was able to attain. Franken tries to be upbeat throughout as he rests on his comedic talent. But, after watching the Senate Intelligence Hearings and Trumpâ€™s response congressional hearings televised on what seems to be a daily basis, a special prosecutor, and a chief executive who demands fealty as if he was â€œthe godfatherâ€ it was good to read an uplifting political manifesto in the form of a biography that the past few days we all must be careful because what we are witnessing cannot be good for our country, which seems to be what motivates Franken each day-what is good for our country.

4 stars!!!
When I started to read this book, I have to admit I did find it a bit confusing and hard to get into. Fortunately, I'm glad to have kept at it because the story turned out better than I expected. I would classify this novel as new adult as opposed to young adult as there are adult situations within the book. Besides this, I feel that Callie Bates writes beautifully. I found the worldbuilding exceptionally intriguing, as well as the prose, flowed smoothly. The magic system in place was written gorgeously and I liked how the system was based on nature. The descriptions were very vivid and colourful. I also commend her for the complex history of the characters' world as well as the beliefs that they held. I felt that these details added richness to the overall plot. I also enjoyed how the world was built around the Rococo period from the descriptions of the clothes and setting. This point of reference helped to visualise the world from a distinctly French-inspired period angle.
In terms of the characters, Elanna was an engaging character and we see significant development her character as the story unravels. However, I couldn't really relate to her and I found many of her actions irritating. She is painted as a woman who is fierce and is on a journey of self discovery. But it seems that she is being constantly saved by others. In this regard, I feel the minor characters played a major role in adding dimension to the story as opposed to the MC. She does redeem herself towards the end of the novel, but by then, I had given up on endearing to her character. I just found the plot to be more enticing.
The overall plot of the novel is infused with politics, betrayal, romance, family drama, murder and so on. There were a lot of action sequences which were thrilling. But, I have to admit that some chapters did contain a lot of info-dumping which slowed down the pacing of the plot. On the other hand, I did find the revelations and tying up of loose ends to be satisfying if not a bit rushed. Since, this book is part of a series I would have preferred a more dramatic end or some sort of cliff hanger. The same could be said of the romance, it felt like the MC had won on many levels. I would have preferred a messier ending to have me more excited for the sequel. Anyway, I still did enjoy the book for its complexity and writing. I would recommend reading this novel if you are looking for something a tad bit unique in the upper YA/NA fantasy genre. Just keep i mind, that it is quite a heavy read, I wouldn't say call it a light afternoon sort of novel :) (less)",Positif

Being an audio book, it took me a bit of time to get into. At least a quarter of the way through I felt one of the love stories sort of reminded me of the movie Pearl Harbor.
The story follows 2 women who meet while on their way to become war nurses. They eventually meet another nurse who they befriend as well. Each woman's reason for volunteering and finding love during war are the focal points of the book.

â€œScivolÃ² giÃ¹, sempre piÃ¹ giÃ¹. Pensava che immergersi di notte non fosse molto diverso dall'immergersi nella Wallabout Bay, che aveva una scarsa visibilitÃ . Ma scoprÃ¬ che l'opacitÃ  fangosa della baia almeno si vedeva. Qui invece non c'era nessuna differenza fra aprire gli occhi e tenerli chiusi. Questo le dava uno strano spaesamento, come se scivolasse verso il nulla o galleggiasse nel vuoto. Quando raggiunse finalmente il fondo, sbattÃ¨ gli occhi nel buio tenendosi stretta alla corda e si chiese se non fosse scesa troppo in fretta. Uno strattone alla cima di salvataggio, ricambiato, la rimise in sesto. La corrente era decisamente meno forte, sul fondale. Anna chiuse gli occhi e ritrovÃ² immediatamente la calma. Era una cecitÃ  che le riusciva sopportabileâ€.
Ambientato nella New York della fine anni '30 e anni '40, questo romanzo Ã¨ creato in un mondo privo della cultura dell'immagine e della connessione perpetua: un mondo che ospita differenti universi, il porto navale, il sindacato, le donne, le ballerine, i gangsters, i banchieri, i marinai e i soldati. Egan scrive un libro di lontananza estrema, un libro di distanza nel tempo, un libro di perdita di presenze. Il mare ha le sue vittime, i viaggi e le migrazioni, tiene l'uomo che con la tecnica cerca di abitarlo, di sopravvivere ad esso; e poi certo Ã¨ il simbolo principale del mistero e dell'inconscio. Quindi il mare di Brooklyn, insieme ad Anna, una donna di origini irlandesi, Ã¨ il protagonista di Manhattan Beach. Una donna trova nel mare un luogo di trasformazione e di cambiamento, perfino di accesso alla memoria e al familiare: cerca il padre, conosce un amante, ama la madre, la sorella e gli amici, scopre nuove possibilitÃ  in sÃ© stessa. La storia composta da Egan Ã¨ coinvolgente e frutto di ricerca, la sua prosa Ã¨ sempre coinvolgente, e talvolta porta meraviglia o trascendenza, forse perchÃ© resta ancorata alle onde della storia, alle cause del contingente, al concreto sviluppo dei fatti. Indubbiamente Egan narra vicende ricchissime: l'amore nella sofferenza, la lotta delle minoranze, il superamento dei confini, la femminilitÃ  forte e poetica. Il mare, come il deserto, cattura il passaggio, lo nasconde allo sguardo, e lo annichilisce. Il testo di Egan ha la struttura di un romanzo storico convenzionale, ma al suo interno siamo nomadi e sognatori dentro innesti di trame e sottotrame, anticipazioni e digressioni e flashback; la Egan ha dedicato dieci anni alle ricerche: la corrispondenza tra impiegati dei Naval Yards, le interviste ai palombari e le storie orali sul sistema bancario e le ombre del mondo della malavita. Il dolce incedere delle donne del romanzo, persino il loro mancare, illumina mirabilmente la fragilitÃ  del nostro esistere. Si incrociano i destini e si uniscono inestricabili e ci sono gli inganni di Anna e l'inganno della Egan nel suggerire che le profonditÃ  siano tanto buie e oscure, da lasciare una percezione di niente al nostro continuo e persistente sguardo sull'immagine del mondo, sulle parole che scorrono tra le pagine. Ogni tanto siate pazienti, siate antichi; per scendere giÃ¹ Ã¨ utile molta calma. (less)",Positif
,"Historical, Romance, Fiction, Regency",Julia Wilson,"The Dishonorable Miss DeLancey by Carolyn Miller is a most delightful Christian historical romance which I adored. It is the third book in the Regency Brides series and can be read as a stand-alone. However for maximum enjoyment and to understand the character development, it would be best to read the previous two books.
Once again Carolyn Miller has spun a fabulous tale. There is adventure, jealousy, kidnap, revenge and good old fashioned love. Over it all there is God. A God who ""answer[s] even unspoken prayers."" A God who is closer to us than we realise and who desires to know us.
The novel is about restoration, second chances and new beginnings. As characters come to know Jesus, they get their priorities in order. Life is not about money and power, it is about people and passion.
There is the theme of identity. ""Who are you?"" It is only in knowing Jesus that we can really find out who we are.
The tale is about sacrifice and selfless living, helping others who are less well off. ""Focusing on something other than herself... was releasing."" We get joy from giving.
Forgiveness and guilt are dual themes. Past behaviour means we need to forgive ourselves and others.
Friendships are important. We all need friends who will build us up and not tear us down. Friends who will love us even when they hear the worst of us. ""It is only when we are at our lowest that we realise our need for Someone higher."" When we reach rock bottom, we will find our Saviour waiting for us to love and restore us.
This Regency Brides series has been a cracking one, with fabulous storylines and wonderful characters. It has been an absolute pleasure to read. I have loved having a different character focus in each book, whilst retaining familiar characters on the periphery.
Roll on the next series from the new and highly talented Carolyn Miller.

I was so engrossed, it was almost hard to distinguish one talent from the other: the narrators voice or the authors writing. Jesmyn Ward was a new author to me.
I remember I cringed at times - and thought the language was beautiful.
NO SPOILERS
.....many other reviews came before me - excellent ones describing the plot and sharing about the characters. I read Michael's review which had me running to find this book on Netgalley. I didn't even know a new release was coming out.
His review is wonderful. I recommend reading his review- its terrific!
I wrote this review mostly in context - 'AS A WHOLE'...not many details about the characters and the story. However, this novel will stay with me a long time. Its wonderful. I like it even more than ""Salvage the Bones"". (and I liked that too!)
I enjoyed 'reading' Jesmyn's writing very much. ( no audiobook this time). Page after page -- there is wonderful prose.
I loved how the story begins.......
""I like to think I know what death is. I like to think it's something I could look at straight. When Pop tell me he need my help and I see that black knife slid into the belt of his pants, I leave Mam sleep in her bed and my little sister Kayla sleep on a blanket on the floor, and I follow Pop out the house, try to keep my back straight, my shoulders even as a hanger; that's how Pop walks"".
Jesmyn is a magnificent writer, and storyteller. Although an easy storyline to follow itself - I spent extra time thinking about the individual characters. Visual pictures were solid in my brain.
Each one of characters were dealing with transition- change - suffering -and other losses.
Each character in this novel had to confront the curves life threw at them - be it illness - drugs - poverty - racial inequity - massive disappointments - fears - regret - abuse -
narcissistic illusional protection - and other realities every human being would prefer to avoid.
Morning breakfast anyone?
Cold goat for breakfast with gravy and rice .. was cooked in a pot that Pop tells Jojo...is leaking cancer into the food because the enamel on the inside is peeling off like paint. Isn't this the way you start your day? And greet your kids with news of their first morning meal? Yeah.... thought so!
Kidding aside-- about the breakfast...... there's a great deal of sadness in this novel
but WE FACE OUR THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS WITH GRACE..... because Jasmyn Ward is skilled in opening up our hearts and mind -- to take a deeper look at some very serious issues --without leaving us ( the readers) to bleed to death either. Jasmyn has crafted an important path to understanding more about ourselves - the world we live in -and the nature of reality ....a touch of spiritualistic mythology.

A pop star.
A regular girl.
The world's watching.
WOW! This book was addictive, heart-warming, and so well-written!! I read it in one non-stop sitting because I just did not want to put it down! If you're looking for a new rock star romance to fall in love with, check this out!
""Under ordinary circumstances, Oakley Ford and Vaughn Bennett would never even cross paths...""
The story begins when Vaughn, a completely down-to-earth, no-bullshit, no-nonsense girl who has sacrificed her college life to waitress and financially support her younger siblings after their parents were killed, is offered an unexpected job that has the power to change her life. The publicity team behind Oakley Ford -- the most famous teenage pop star on the planet -- is willing to pay her twenty thousand dollars a month to pretend to be his girlfriend. She's baffled by the absurdity of the concept, and has no patience for his drama, but hey if they're willing to pay her that much money to pretend to be in love with this guy, who is she to say no?
â€œThey want you to pretend to be Oakley Fordâ€™s girlfriend this year.â€
I spray the concrete steps with lukewarm coffee mixed with spit. â€œWhat?â€
â€œI promise you it isnâ€™t as bad as it soundsâ€¦ Theyâ€™ll pay you twenty thousand a month.â€
I spin around slowly, my mouth hanging open. â€œAre you offing kidding me?â€¦ That wouldâ€¦â€
â€œPut the boys through college? Pay off both our mortgages? Make everything easier for us? Yes.â€
Oakley is no happier about their situation. Having grown up in the spotlight as a child star, he now only wants to be taken seriously as an artist. Sure, he's made bucket loads of money being a pop star, but his fan base is mostly rabid, slightly crazed teenage girls. The music he's shelling out just isn't the sound he wants to be creating and as such, he's lost his mojo. Not to mention that despite his awards and fame, his reputation has recently taken a beating and he needs a more wholesome image to sell to the press to give them a reason to believe in him again. Enter Vaughn.
If pretending to date a girl I donâ€™t know, who doesnâ€™t like me, gets [my mojo] back, then Iâ€™ll be the best boyfriend this chick has ever had.
Oakley and Vaughn were polar opposites. Even at nineteen, Oak was used to the fake facade of fame, to the privacy intrusions, gossip lies, and unwanted attention. He was a bit egotistical and spoiled but ultimately had a very good heart underneath everything. And for him, Vaughn's lack of adoration, fangirlyness, and her unfiltered sass and honesty was exactly the reality check he so desperately needed. But she was still new to his whole world and after signing the contract, her life spiralled into lies built on lies -- with each move either of them made being calculated deliberately by a room full of publicity managers, PR consultants, and lawyers.
â€œSo are we going to talk about terms? Like, what are my work hours?â€ I ask coolly, cradling the pop can between my hands.
â€œWork hours?â€ Claudia echoes, a tiny furrow appearing on her forehead.
â€œYeah, since this is my job.â€
She titters. â€œNot a job, more like aâ€¦â€
â€œRole?â€ one of her assistants offers.
â€œYes. A role in a long, romantic movie. And youâ€™re the two leads.â€
However, in the midst of the crazy new pretend relationship that they were selling to the press, something real began to grow between them. It was unexpected and thrilling. They'd been fooling the world into thinking they were a real couple, until they realized that the only people they were fooling were themselves...
I rub her arms. Kiss the top of her head. Remind myself that this is about her and that Iâ€™m a terrible human being for enjoying the closeness between us. This is the only time sheâ€™s willingly allowed me to hold her. There arenâ€™t any cameras here. This isnâ€™t for show.
This is as real and as awful and as wonderful as it gets. Iâ€™d hold her forever if sheâ€™d let me.
Now, just because I knowww that many of you will be wondering about this, I'll tell you that yes, Vaughn does have a boyfriend in the beginning of the book for a while. I don't consider it a love triangle though at all because it's clear to anyone that her boyfriend is a selfish douche and isn't close to worthy of being the hero of this story (or any other one) so yeah, it's a little annoying, but they did a good job explaining why she was with him so his character made sense for the part he played in this story.
I loved many things about this book. I loved that even though Oak had so many opportunities to be a manwhore in his life with all the girls constantly throwing themselves at him, he actually had standards and a sense of loyalty. He was a one-woman man and I really respected that quality about him. I loved that Vaughn wasn't a pushover when it came to Oakley. Despite his fame, she had no problem dishing out the sarcasm, attitude, and she didn't sugar coat her feelings. She kept things real with him and I loved her honesty.
â€œYou realize there are millions of girls out there who would kill to be sitting beside me right now?â€ I say tightly.
She flips the book open, not even looking at me. â€œYeah? Then why are you paying me to do it?â€
This is a standalone novel that kind of rides the line between mature YA and early NA. The hero and heroine are in their late teens, and there is some sex but not very much. It's also written in first person from alternating POVs. It's lightly angsty in places, but nothing gut-wrenching. The romance is very sweet, slow-burning (but believable) and the ending was completely heart-warming, swoony, and satisfying. It left me smiling!
â€œTouring isnâ€™t all that itâ€™s cracked up to be. Itâ€™s a lot of work and the down days are often spent traveling from one location to another. You miss your family, your friends, even your on bed.â€
â€œThat actually sounds amazing,â€ I tell him.
We lock eyes. â€œYou should come with me next time.â€
â€œMaybe I will.â€ I grinâ€¦
â€œAnd on that note, I think Iâ€™m going inside,â€ Carrie announced. â€œYou, too, Kiki.â€ She pulls Kiki off the railings.
â€œBut I wanna see what happens next,â€ Kiki wails.
Oakâ€™s lips curve up.
â€œTheyâ€™re not a television show,â€ Carrie scolds as she drags Kiki inside the house.
â€œNo, theyâ€™re better.â€
As soon as I started reading the first few pages of this book, I fell in love with loved the writing. Erin Watt has a fun, fresh, addictive voice that just compels you to keep reading. I'm definitely going to be on the look out for their next books and I highly recommend this one as a great rock star romance and a new favorite!
Rating: 4 - 4.5 stars! Standalone Contemporary Romance. Mature YA/Early NA.

,"Mystery, Fiction, Thriller, Mystery Thriller, Contemporary",Sue,"GIRL IN THE SNOW is the debut novel by Danya Kukafka, while listed as a mystery /thriller I feel is more of a character-driven mystery with YA overtunes.
While this is the story of the murder of a small-town Colorado teenage girl, Lucinda Hayes, the novel focuses on three characters; Cameron who was obsessed with Lucinda, and stalked her, Jade who was jealous of Lucindaâ€™s good looks and Russ, the officer assigned to investigate her murder.
â€œIn the aftermath of the tragedy, these three indelible charactersâ€”Cameron, Jade, and Russâ€”must each confront their darkest secrets in an effort to find solace, the truth, or both.â€
All four characters have deep dark secrets.
I must say that I found this novel slow movingâ€¦I was disappointed as I felt that the focus was not on the murder/police investigation, but rather in the heads of three strange characters. I was looking for more action and suspense to hold my attention. The prose is articulate, the pacing is slow, and the ending is predictable.

,"Fiction, Mystery, Crime, Thriller, Mystery Thriller",Diane S â˜”,"The mean streets of New York, Denny Malone, leader of a special unit of cops, respected and feared, the city is his territory and his group know as Da Force. He is telling his story from a cell, but how did this king of the streets, at the top of his game, descend so low?
When I first started reading this I thought or I hoped this wouldn't be a cliched viewpoint of every had cop story we hear about. The writing though was addictive, and I kept telling myself that this was the top pick in book page. The more I read the more I felt that rather than a cliched this was in your face realism, a realism I found so intense that my leg was jiggling up and down as I was reading. Do I agree with what they did? No, but these men are confronted daily with threats to their lives, drug, guns, gangs, the mob, cartels and expected to clean this up. Pressured from above, their Captain, the commissioner, the mayor, pressured by crime statistics, results wanted but the powers that be don't want to know how it is done as long as the numbers decreased. Nothing clear cut, morals are blurred, lines are blurred. Denny's character? He is not all one thing either, as complex as many of us are, kind and cruel, crooked and honest. It is easy to sit on my couch and disapprove of much here that I have read, but I have a feeling that in many large cities this happens often.
This book has already been optioned as a film, and if done well it should prove to be an impactful one.
This has also been compared to Mystic River and since I was blown away when I read that one and was blown away by the end of this, I find that a very apt comparison.

,"Christian Fiction, Historical, romance, Historical, Christian ",Dave,"As an author myself, the title of this book and the captivating image on the cover was enough to pull me onto the first page with ease. To find out a good portion of the book takes place in Florida was only made better when I discovered the town in Florida was Cocoa Beach, my metaphorical backyard.
As a sophomore novelist struggling to find inspiration, Tenley is a relatable character with quirky habits, superstitions, and ideas about how to course correct her ship floating aimlessly in turbulent waters of the authorial ocean.
Even more so, the way Birdie is portrayed, and her strong presence as a woman in the early 20th century was both inspiring and motivating, to stand up for what one believes in, whether it's the pursuit of love, or the pursuit of loving what you do.
Ms. Hauck does a wonderful job of capturing the language from a bygone era in a convincing and compelling way. The way each portion of the story (past and present) interleaved with the other created a plot that was well-crafted and well-presented.
I recognize that this title was shelved in the Christian fiction section of my local Barnes & Noble, and I've read several titles from those same bookshelves in the past. I am certainly not averse to the presentation of theological values in a novel, but the level to which they were presented in this story went beyond what I was accustomed to. It didn't detract from my enjoyment of the story, but some of the references felt out of sync with the mood of the story, for this reader at least.
In the end, this was an enjoyable read that reminded me inspiration arrives from many places and in varied ways. And, what we do with that inspiration may create a meandering path, one that feels uncertain and foreign, but one we are destined to walk if only we trust in the possibilities presented to us.

,"Christian Fiction, Historical, romance, Historical, Christian ",Kelly Bridgewater,"I adore Jen Turano's writing. She creates such realistic historical characters that jump off the page. Her heroines are never the typical women of the time period. They enjoy acting out of the societal norms, which I love. Her writing is crisp and clean with abundant descriptions to keep me in the setting. There isn't too much or too less description. Just enough to keep my imagination flowing as the characters move around in the setting. I was really excited to read Out of the Ordinary, and Turano didn't disappoint.
In Out of the Ordinary, I really enjoyed getting to know Gertrude Cadwalader a lot more. She is an unique individual with a personality to match. She is independent and isn't afraid to stand up for what she believes in. The hero, Harrison Sinclair, is a color-blind man who wears horrible non-matching clothes, even by today's standards. But even through the outward appearance he portrays, Gertrude sees past all that and falls in love with the sweet and protective man underneath. Their romance has a friendship base and makes for a great love story.
I have read many reviews where they mention that Turano is a hilarious writer. Usually, I don't find anything funny about her plots, but this time around, she really did make the plot funny. She put Gertrude in a number of different scenarios that made me shake my head and smile. I really enjoyed how toward the end Turano had Harrison do something, but it went horribly wrong. It was funny! I really enjoyed this novel and wanted to read it in a day, but life happened, and I did finish it in four days. I loved this story.
Overall, Out of the Ordinary by Jen Turano is anything but ordinary. There are moments of pure laughter with a delightful cast of characters that had me flipping through the pages to see what other situation they can find themselves in. I truly LOVED this story, and I can't wait for the next installment in this series from Turano. Fans of Lorna Seilstad and Cara Lynn James should pick these books up.
I received a complimentary copy of Out of the Ordinary by Jen Turano from Bethany House Publishers, but the opinions stated are all my own. (less)",Positif
,"Mystery, Fiction, Humor, Audiobook",Sheri,"A line from the book sums up the story quite nicely: ""another whackadoodle conspiracy theory obsession."" And just like Riley, I got sucked in too. Was it a conspiracy? Was Emerson really off his rocker this time? I had to read on to find out the who, what, where, and when of Riley and Emerson's latest mission. What craziness would ensue this time?
A fun quick read, yet at times I felt as if the author was trying too hard. I got really tired of reading the idiom ""for the love of Mike"" and even some of Vernon's antics just seemed forced. It's not my favorite Evanovich series, but honestly, I will keep reading just for the zany adventures and the light read. (less)",Positif

,"Romance, Adult Fiction, Erotica, Bdsm, Fiction, Adult",Sophia Triad,"After I read this book and then I read a few reviews about this book,
I do not wish to write a review.
I just want to point out three things:
1. You never insult other readers/reviewers who like/love/adore a book/series that you hate. Please.
2. If you don't like the first book in the series and give a rating of 1 star, you don't have to read the second book in the series. Not much will change. So, obviously you will give 1 star again.
And if you don't like the second book in the series, you really don't have to read the third book in the series. There is no point. You only torture yourself.
And if you don't like the third book in the series, for heaven's sake, don't read the forth book in the series.
And if you still read the forth book in the series (why???), you still do not have to read the fifth book in the series. Nobody will force you. Nobody will blame you. You are free not to read it. Honestly.
Which brings me to my 3rd point.
3. If you haven't read the above mentioned books; you seriously do not have to rate them and/or even review them.
This series has opened a new world to me. And I believe I am sensible enough to understand
-What is right and what is wrong
-What is incorrect and what is under particular standards
-What is reality and what is over the top fiction

,"Music, Nonfiction, History, Biography, Autobiography, Memoir",Big Al,"Oral history in the style of Please Kill Me hyping up a more recent New York music scene. Not nearly as iconic or fun to read about as the 70s punk scene in Please Kill Me, but still an entertaining and nostalgic look back on a time (not that long ago) when rock music still mattered. Right from the beginning I was not feeling the over the top glorification of New York City (THE ONLY PLACE IN THE WORLD that matters for cool people apparently), nor did I think the long page count was justified. I picked this up because of The Strokes, so I enjoyed following the career trajectory of this band along with the gossipy commentary.

,"Mystery, Fiction",Kathy,"Song of the Lion by Anne Hillerman is an absolutely riveting mystery about a car bombing during an alumni basketball at Shiprock High School. Although this latest release is the twenty-first installment in the Leaphorn, Chee & Manuelito series, it can easily be read as a standalone.
Navajo Tribal Police Officer Bernadette ""Bernie"" Manuelito is off duty at the basketball game when she hears an explosion that sounds close by. Rushing to the parking lot, she discovers one of the vehicles has exploded and she quickly takes charge of the situation. After discovering the owner of the car is Aza Palmer, a lawyer who is mediating a proposal for a controversial resort that will be built on the Navajo Reservation, Bernie's husband, Sergeant Jim Chee is assigned to guard Aza during an upcoming forum. When the identity of the man who was killed at the bomb site is discovered, Bernie hopes retired Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn might help fill in the blanks about the deceased man's past. With tensions running high between protestors who are hoping to kill the resort project, will Jim and Bernie figure out who wants to kill Aza before it is too late?
Although the bombing case is quickly turned over the a variety of federal agencies, Bernie continues trying to understand the connection between the deceased, Richard Horseman, and Aza Palmer. Both men grew up on the reservation, but their lives took dramatically different turns. Aza is a very successful lawyer based in Arizona and this is not the first time he has worked as a mediator. Richard, on the other hand, has a bit of a checkered past which includes brushes with the law and an alcohol problem. According to his grandmother, Marie Nez, her grandson has left his problems behind and has been diligently working on steering clear of trouble. If Mrs. Nez's assertions are true, then Bernie wants to know why he was near Aza's car the night of the explosion. Could the reason be completely innocent?
Meanwhile, Jim has his hands full trying to protect Aza. The biggest threat to the lawyer at this point is his stubborn refusal to heed Jim's pleas to maintain a low profile and stop going off on his own. Jim is also rather troubled when a young man keeps appearing on the scene and his questions to Aza about the man's identity go unanswered. As the protestors step up their efforts to sabotage the public discussion, Jim is grateful for the extra help when Bernie unexpectedly decides to spend her days off with him. But even with the both of them keeping an eye on Aza, can they keep him out of harm's way?
Despite the injuries that still plague Joe Leaphorn, he is still a vital resource with a formidable amount of information from his years on the police force. Bernie hopes Joe will be able to provide background information about Richard's past and her patience pays off once he begins searching through old records. Does Joe hold the key which will break the case wide open?
Song of the Lion is a fast-paced and intriguing police procedural that is quite compelling. Anne Hillerman does an outstanding job providing readers with fascinating information about Native American culture. The investigation moves along at a brisk pace and there are several unexpected twists and turns that will keep readers invested in the resolution of the case. Although the identity of the perpetrator is rather easy to surmise, the novel comes to an action-packed and rather dramatic conclusion. Old and new fans of the Leaphorn, Chee & Manuelito series will be absolutely delighted with this latest outing which features a topical storyline and a fascinating mystery.

,"Mystery, Thriller, Fiction, Suspense, Mystery Thriller",Mary Beth *Traveling Sister*,"4.5 stars!
This is the seventh book in the Quincy and Rainie Series.
I just love this series and I could not put this book down.
Lisa Gardner is one of my favorite authors. I have read all of her books. I love Quincy and Rainie. I was beyond thrilled when I heard that we would be getting a new book in this series.
Right Behind You is a mystery/suspense/thriller. The case/mystery is unique to this book. However, there is a lot of back story with Rainie and Quincy that you will miss out on if you start with book #7. This series is phenomenal and I would definitely encourage everyone to start from the beginning. But you won't be lost if you pick up this book without having read the others. Make sure that you have a lot of time on your hands when reading this book because I think everyone would have a hard time putting it down. It is a page turner filled with twists and a lot of suspense. It will make your heart pound.
A teenager with a troubled past becomes the prime suspect in a string of brutal murders, but exâ€“FBI profiler Pierce Quincy and his partner, Rainie Conner, think thereâ€™s more to the story.
For the past three years, Pierce and Rainie have fostered Sharlah Nash, now 13, with the hope of soon adopting her. Sharlahâ€™s childhood is the epitome of troubled: when she was 5, her drug-addict father killed her mother and then tried to kill her and her older brother, Telly, but Telly, then 9, bashed his head in with a baseball bat. The siblings were fostered apart, with Sharlah ending up with Pierce and Rainie, whose expertise as parents seems to come from their combined resumes as a former criminal profiler and cop, respectively. Telly, we learn in expansive flashbacks from the now-teenagerâ€™s point of view (Sharlah has her own, crowding an already packed narrative), bounced around before landing, age 17, with Frank and Sandra Duvall, a kind couple who are obviously not what they seem. In what appears to be an explosion of unexplained rage, Telly allegedly murders the Duvalls and then kills two people in a gas station before heading off into the Oregon woods, sparking a manhunt and fears that heâ€™s coming after Sharlah. Pierce and Rainie work with local law enforcement to build a psychological profile of the teenâ€”which is questionable given the excessive amount of guesswork and second- and thirdhand information usedâ€”while trying to protect their daughter from harm.
This series is very well written. The characters are believable and very easy to imagine. I felt so sorry for Telly and loved his sister Sharlah who was a very brave girl, and of course I love Quincy and Rainie also.
I recommend this book to everyone that loves a good thriller. (less)",Positif

,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Did Not Finish, Magic, Fiction",Fables&Wren,"WrensReads Review:
ARC in exchange for an honest review
I was skeptical about this book when I read the synopsis. Thereâ€™s a girl who has it all and then all of a sudden she doesnâ€™t and then she has to lead the rebellion. To me, it kind of seems done, but I also kind of love a broken person rising above it all and becoming the reason the world changes. So I requested, I got, and... I didnâ€™t love it.
Donâ€™t get me wrong, it was unique in some of its concepts and it was written with beautiful lyrical words. But some of it was... Iâ€™m not sure; I just wasnâ€™t on board for it. And some I never quite grasped the concept on what in the world was going on.
Half the time I was retracting because there were just a lot of things to remember. There were a ton of kingdoms and characters and I didnâ€™t fall in love with any of them. Thereâ€™s a line between giving a ton of information to grow the world you want the reader to explore and just information explosion.
And, as I said, I just didnâ€™t fall in love with any of the characters. Actually, the main character kind of annoyed me with her bipolar feelings (and I read that a lot of other people felt the same way so I know I am not just crazy). And her, like â€œsuper powerâ€ was never really explained and it was kind of weird.
The author has a way with words, but I feel this world could have been explained better. I will read other books by this author as she grows as a writer because I can feel the potential in her words.

Suspicious Behavior is book #2 in the Bad Behavior series about Detectives Darren Corliss and his partner Andreas Ruffner. I don't feel as if it's absolutely necessary for you to read book #1 in order to follow this one, but I would recommend it. Book 1 focuses a bit more on them starting their relationship. In this book, they are already together, but it focuses much more on the events around them than their actual relationship. They are trying to catch a serial killer before he kills his next victim, and also dealing with some family issues on both sides. While I very much enjoyed the suspense/mystery aspect of the story, I thought the romance side of things was lacking a lot in this one. I missed their chemistry and sweet moments together. There were a few great moments between them but I wanted a bit more. I understand the primary focus in this one being their jobs and family tho, because it made the story feel more ""real"". Some times with as crazy as life can get, it's hard to find moments together. I liked that Suspicious Behavior started the ball rolling with them realizing how deep their feelings for each other were, and for Andreas to come clean to his daughter about his diagnoses and his relationship with Darren. I can't wait to see what the next book brings!

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Romance, Fiction, Mystery, Adult, Writing, Books About Books",AngryGreyCat,"The Romance Readerâ€™s Guide to Life by Sharon Pywell was a total impulse read. I was at the library perusing the new arrivals shelf and the title and the beautiful cover lured me in. The book follows two sisters, Lilly and Neave, and their drive to build a Mary Kay type cosmetic empire. Neave is the â€œromance readerâ€ and chapters of Neave and Lillyâ€™s lives are interspersed with chapters from a romance novel that is her inspiration, The Pirate Lover. Lilly is murdered and is spending her time in the afterlife, as a ghost with the family dogâ€™s ghost as a companion, trying to help Neave. There are other siblings as well, a child of Lillyâ€™s, an immigrant chemist, and a couple of love interests to round out the cast.
All of the characters are done very well and this is a lovely read in the family relationship pieces and an intriguing read in the murder mystery sections with a dashes of humor expertly placed. The novel highlights the plight of women in the 30s through to some time in the 70s, the lack of prosecution for domestic violence, lack of job opportunities, and cultural expectations. The novel does not fit easily into a genre, rather it straddles lines intersecting mystery, romance, general fiction, paranormal and historical. I enjoyed it and would recommend it. (less)",Positif

,"Mystery, Thriller, Fiction, Suspense, Romance",Scoats,"If Michael Bay was two women novelists, this what he/she would create. Everything is EPIC!
- Lots of exotic locations: Venice, Capri, Manhattan, (and I'm sure more).
- Superhuman characters: the world's best thief (uber-rich), uber-rich evil fraternal twins and the brother's super-assassin girlfriend, two super FBI agents who are given a new unit with an unlimited budget.
- A super, doomsday weapon that controls the weather.
- DaVinci Code mystical stuff, including a direct reference to that book.
I have frequently faulted writers who write stuff that is hard to read. I definitely can't fault them here. But while the prose is quite readable, it's slightly insipid and lacks any style or fun.
Just like I can't make it through a Michael Bay movie, I couldn't get past the 5th chapter. With 400 pages left, I got out while the getting was good.
Being cowritten by two best selling female authors, there are a lot of strong female characters. I dig the girl power thing, but it's not enough to stop me from giving up.

Alice Clayton
â­â­â­â­
Alice Clayton never cease to be awesome. She works her magic in every book.
Clara is workaholic and very good at her job, and recently she got an offer for a promotion if she did well on this last project. Little did she know promotion is the last thing she will be seeing.
Archie and his family's hotel had been successful up until their hotel business is not in demand anymore and it is Clara's job to make it busy again.
These two are two can't stand each other, they couldn't agree on anything. No one wants to loose in an arguement and no one is yielding. The sexual tension is undeniable but it won't be professional if anyone yielded to the lust, especially Clara if she's vying for partner.
But soon they cannot take it anymore, these two caved and it was beyond awesome.
Little did Archie know that Clara has a commitment issue and at first he did not understand it. On the other hand Archie was still hung up on his dead wife's passing he couldn't bear losing even his wedding ring.
They agreed to keep it platonic, just physical not attachments and definitely no falling in love.
How will their relationship blossom will be up to you to read.
Their story is a journey in falling and finding love once again, getting hurt but it will be worth it. Exciting and hot steamy love making on this book making sure to keep your beds warm at night. Who doesn't love a red head nerd hottie?! Come on ladies! Grubs up for this book it'll be worth it. *wink*

,"Mystery, Fiction, Thriller, Crime, Mystery Thriller",Phrynne,"Thought I might open this review with a quote from my review of the previous book in the series:-
""We leave the book with Cork in a happy place but I fully expect that to be wiped out quickly in the next book. Pretty sure the author will not want to write about a happy hero.""
I was so right!
Interestingly Sulfur Springs is written from Cork's POV and it actually does open with him in a happy place but this lasts about three pages before the dreaded phone rings and he has to pursue another missing, maybe dead, person at great cost to his own personal safety. After sixteen books we know the routine now but funnily enough that does not stop me from enjoying the book at all!
What was new in this story was that it took place in very different scenery than usual, far away in the heat and desert in Arizona. It was still beautifully described and it made a change not to feel cold and wet while reading! There was lots of action, the usual high body count and some good sleuthing on Cork's part. He does make a good detective.
Sadly this brings me up to date in the series so far although I am happy to see there is a new release coming up in a few short months.

Well, I just can say it was a good-easy read. I loved the first installment in this series but this one fell flat for me. For the first half I really struggled and I wanted to lost-interested it but then it got a little exciting and then again it fell flat. Maybe I read it at the bad timing because Iâ€™m in a bad mood. But to be honest, I liked those two adorable characters; theyâ€™re so cute and so perfect for each other. They know each other completely.
The story told in dual POV, 1st person. Imagines is the second installment in Imago series and it should be read in order. Hope you enjoy it! (less)",Netral
,"Romance, Contemporary, New Adult, Contemporary Romance",Michelle,"Beautiful luv story.
This is the first time I 've read anything from this author. I actually doing know how I this book was going to work for me but I have to say it won't be the last book I read from this author it was amazing. The story was just beautiful heart breaking in parts but beautiful. The luv between the characters was so strong even after spending years a part and thinking bad of each other. It was still strong they were just so meant to be they had to get there HEA. I know this book is a modern fairy tale of The Little Mermaid but I really luvd the way the author put in lil bit that reminded me of the fairy tale. The Little Mermaid is one of my favourite stories as a child and now I can say that this is going to one as an adult.
I really enjoyed the characters in this. My heart went out to Laire she was so naive about life outside of the little island of Corey she needed someone like Erik to show her how there was more to life than little Corey. I do think that the characters were similar in some ways they both kept secrets from there family's to protect each which did happen to go against them. But they had to do what they had to do to get the most out of an amazing summer together.
Erik is very sexy but very sweet the way he dealt with Laire was sweet. I did find it funny him explaining stuff to Laire in parts with her not really knowing much about the opposite sex I could find how uncomfortable he was but he did deal with it well. This made me really like him and his character a lot.
Laire is a really good character to. It was great to see how she dealt with everything that was thrown at her. I did get angry in parts with her family. They were just so meant and made her feel like crap. I'm just glad she did get on with things and didn't let her family get in the way even if it did mean it came with consequences. It was great to see Laire grow from this naive girl to a strong woman that stuck up for herself. I was cheering her on throughout the book.
I would highly recommend this book. Once I started I couldn't put it down. Like I said was sure if I'd like it but ended up luvin it. Can't wait to read more of this authors work.

This relatively short installment of the Frontlines series finds Grayson and his wife Hallie as veteran officers in the NAC, now allied with the rest of the Earth against the alien Lankies. Now that the Earth infighting and politics are mostly sorted, this book focuses much more on the mysterious alien invaders. More so than previous books and we get some answers to questions from the beginning of the series including just how smart are these aliens? There's also some intriguing questions raised as well, pretty much guaranteeing there will be more in the series.

Two pregnant ladies - one whose baby is unplanned, the other whose baby is planned down to the tiniest detail. Their paths were bound to cross, the common bond discovered.
It's probably happened to all of us at one time or another. You make an offhand comment, pay a compliment, or maybe flash a quick smile to a complete stranger. Could be someone waiting in line at the post office, or perhaps a waitress, or maybe a grocery clerk. It doesn't matter, all of a sudden you are her best friend in the world. She latches onto you, showing too much interest in your life, a life that is everything she wishes hers could be. You have no idea.
Everyone has a secret, this novel illustrates perfectly just how far one will go to protect that secret. The blame game is played, who has been damaged the most here? Who has made the biggest sacrifice? I suspect this book will go to town when it is released. The pacing is terrific, the characters well developed.

,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Mythology, Romance",Raquel Cordeiro,"Eu nÃ£o canso de me surpreender com a capacidade da Colleen Houck. Acho um dom extremo a pessoa conseguir escrever um livro bom e ruim ao mesmo tempo. A histÃ³ria Ã© legal, sÃ©rio. Ela faz um mesclado entre mitologia e realidade que fica muito bom, deixa interessante, coloca muitos pontos que mostram que a histÃ³ria foi super pesquisada, pensada e estruturada. E, ao mesmo tempo, ela enche o livro de clichÃªs toscos, frases super manjadas e personagens sem graÃ§a e mal feitos. E isso se eu for olhar sÃ³ pra esse livro.
Comparando com ""A MaldiÃ§Ã£o do Tigre"", aÃ­ que a coisa fica feia pra esse, que Ã© uma imitaÃ§Ã£o piorada do primeiro.

Nesse livro, as personagens sÃ£o completamente ruins. SÃ©rio. SÃ£o superficiais, sem identidade prÃ³pria. NÃ£o me identifico com ninguÃ©m, nÃ£o me apaixonei por ninguÃ©m.

The third book in the Mercury Pack series brings us the story of enforcer, Zander and I was happily surprised to learn that his heroine, Gwen, is a human. Itâ€™s an interesting twist already, and when you add in shifter/human drama, family drama, sizzling hotness, a heartfelt romance and a nice amount of action, this is another great read from Suzanne Wright.
Like all of the heroines in this and the Phoenix Pack series, Gwen is strong, smart-mouthed and feisty. But she finds herself in a world of trouble when she protects a lone shifter from an attack by humans and jumps in to defend her, pushing both human and shifter law enforcement to investigate the issue and hand down punishment. It just so happens that the boys who attacked the shifter are from a very wealthy, influential family, and Gwen has been made a target for violence and persecution unless she drops her case.
Zander meets Gwen when he stays at the Inn run by her family. He is attracted to the gorgeous human but he doesnâ€™t do relationships, and his wolf reacts strangely around her, retreating whenever she is near. But when he learns of the trouble she is in, he decides to stick around and offer his protectionâ€¦ allowing them more time to explore the sizzling chemistry between them.
I really liked the progression of things between Zander and Gwen. Of course they are wildly attracted to each other, which is always lots of fun, but the shifter/human dynamic brings a new set of issues for them to contend with, and I thought that was really well done. I loved that Gwen was strong enough to stand up to Zander, holding nothing back and being open with everything she feels, and of course Zander is the demanding, controlling wolf that I love about this series, which creates lots of fireworksâ€¦ and sizzlingy steamy sexy time.
â€œI'm greedy - I want all of you. I want you with me every day and every night.â€
Thereâ€™s a nice emotional element to their relationship as well. Zander and Gwen have both been through a lot in their lives which leads to them holding back. Zanderâ€™s wolf is wary and doesnâ€™t respond well when he gets close to women. And Gwen is all too aware that, as a shifter, Zander has a mate out there waiting for him and she has no intention of standing in the way of that. But despite the barriers, the emotion between them easily and naturally begins to deepen, forcing them to figure out what is important to them and just how far they are willing to go together.
To have someone made specifically for youâ€”someone who would never betray you, never hurt you, and would always cherish youâ€”would be something special.
Alongside the romance, thereâ€™s a great bunch of side characters â€“ old and new â€“ which add to the story, the side-storylines are really well fleshed out and blend in well with the overarching story, and the action is intense and exciting. And of course thereâ€™s a whole lot of snark and banter which is highly entertaining and had me chuckling while I read.
â€œDonâ€™t interrupt me while Iâ€™m ignoring youâ€”thatâ€™s just rude.â€
â€œYouâ€™re good at ignoring people, arenâ€™t you, Gwen?â€
â€œDude, Iâ€™m so good at it, I can make people doubt that theyâ€™re actually alive.â€
I really enjoyed this book. I listened to it as an audiobook, and as always Jill Redfield does a great job. I liked Zander and Gwen as a couple, I could feel their connection and wanted their happy ending, and I really liked the way their story played out. And I thought the way that all of the side stories combined was really well done, creating a great read with action, excitement, laughs and a gorgeous romance.
â€œBaby...I couldn't give you up even if I wanted to.â€

--------------------------------------------------------
TEMA
El libro en resumen es SueÃ±os de Piedra con un final ""diferente"". Creo que es porque Iria y Selene segÃºn sus propias palabras ""consideran a Nocturna pequeÃ±a ya para ellas"" y menos Piratas - Marabilia 3 y la novela por encargo de la editorial sobre realismo mÃ¡gico del Proyecto ChamberÃ­ no sacarÃ¡n mÃ¡s cosas con ellos. (y la novela grÃ¡fica de SdP, pero eso es un derivado).
Tenemos a 3 personajes principales en la novela (aunque intentan que Hera? sea otro personaje muy imprtante, pero podÃ©is iros abajo dÃ³nde la mitologÃ­a a saber quÃ© opino de ella). EstÃ¡ OriÃ³n, Asteria y el ""novio de Asteria"" (Lo llamo asÃ­ porque a) Las autoras no han revelado nada voy a respetarlo en eso y B) no hace otra cosa en la novela.
Total que OriÃ³n que es un dios es castigado por Hera porque su madre la lia parda, (teoricamente la diosa del caos es superior? aquÃ­ y por eso no la castiga Hera? lo importante es que castiguen al chaval y que el parezca que no ha liado nada pero es muy confuso (y la diosa del caos no hace nada a ver si aprende, muy fuerte.... porque en este libro caos no es tomado en el sentido mitolÃ³gico (desorden) sino por definiciÃ³n malo porque la CONFUNDEN con la diosa Discordia romana (que es eris en griego, pero no extienden esa diferencia de concepto). es un rebelde que quiere escapar y un sobrado porque es hijo de dios y su sangre es dorada (es arthmael incluso en el tono).
Asteria es una Amazona a la que la han hecho daÃ±o un hombre y que no tiene confianza en nadie pero es muy fuerte y por eso lleva el pelo corto. (ya ya... MULAN) Emprende una lucha feminista que aÃºn a pesar de encontrar al amor sigue su lucha... (es Lynne y la vÃ¡is a ver usar las mismas justificaciones contra los hombres hasta que curiosamente encuentra al amor de su vida. Igual que Lynne (amores, ahora os explico).
Y luego estÃ¡ el que pone tensiÃ³n en el triÃ¡ngulo amoroso, que es Hazan, hasta que pasa al final, para mÃ­ sobra y la verdad no me esperaba que le fueran molando los dos.
Total, evidentemente se resuelve todo bien como viene siendo habitual en estas autoras, consigue la redenciÃ³n y que el amor les cambie. Y para resolver el triÃ¡ngulo amoroso se marcan UN LAURA GALLEGO; se queda con los dos rollo abierto. (que no tengo nada en contra si el tercero no hubiera sobrado siempre. Ese es el mayor giro de la novela, no os frustrÃ©is, el resto son reflxiones o de ser mujer de manera moralista o de porquÃ© hay seres superiores a otros de manera moralista es mas te dejan caer que a veces los dioses n se sienten superiores a los humanos (sÃ­, ya, no son mundo separados).
MITOLOGÃA
Todos los personajes estÃ¡n sacados, como Hera de hercules (disney) expecto Eris que estÃ¡ sacada de la pelicula de animaciÃ³n Simbad el marino. Se rÃ­en de Zeus los personajes pero ahÃ­ no pasa nada porque el mayor dios de dioses es idio** (que les falta escribirlo asÃ­, mucha libertad sexual para los protas pero para Zeuus no). Tiene alguna traza de Percy Jackson pero se nota mucho que no son fans de esa saga. eso sÃ­: no han cogido un libro de mitologÃ­a en su vida, pero van de expertas inventÃ¡ndose los porquÃ©s de cosas dentro del libro (copiados de las pelÃ­culas que he citado antes que tienen pinta de gustarles mucho).
ASTERIA tiene mucho que reseÃ±ar porque HipÃ³lita (reina mitolÃ³gica de las mazonas) como no es un nombre guay no dice nada, coen los nombres de las amazonas de HipÃ³lita y ya. Por otro lado no dejan claro nada acerca de la titÃ¡nide Asteria, ni hacen referencia,...
Las amazonas las han sacado de XENA, proque no coinciden con Wonder Woman, pero poco les fata, nadad de tribu,... un sistema de relaciÃ³n con los hombres completamente inventado (porque aquÃ­ los hombres o cambian de opiniÃ³n para la verdadera protagonista o son malos y crueles)
En cuanto a los gladiadores, si alguien sois fans de Gema BonnÃ­n (gran promesa de la escritura) os va a hervir la sangre, PEDAZO DE COPIA de ambientaciones de las peleas y cÃ³mo se mueven los personajes. (me refiero a que es una copia de
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2... ARENA ROJA, que claro, ahora me explico yo que nocturna se hubiera negado a sacarlo y el platearselo a Alfaguara). Espero que Gema no se lo tome demasiado mal, porque le copian hasta la rebeldia interior de cuando combaten. De echo ahora que lo pienso casi le estÃ¡n copiando el nombre de la novela y la portada O_O copian las apiraciones dle personaje, la lucha contra alguien con un poder (en el caso de gema por dinero aquÃ­ por ser dioses) superior... T-O-D-O. Si amÃ¡is a Faith asi a querer matar a Iria y Selene.
En el libro de Gema es normal que no sea mitolÃ³gico porque se ambienta de echo en el futuro, pero aquÃ­? y copiarlo asÃ­ siendo compaÃ±era de otra editorial...
NARRATIVA
En la narrativa, estÃ¡ escrito en primera y tercera persona en muy pocas pocas pÃ¡ginas. Creerlo o no pero es asÃ­, parece un intento de aprender a escibir: alguien es dijo que en primera persona no estaba tan valorado como 3Âº persona y se han lanzado asÃ­... a lo loco. Es bastante respetable para juvenil, aunque nos hemos enterado con una vez lo corto que es el pelo de Asteria o cuanto le brilla la sangre o la espada. Luego es muy moralista con doble rasero para las cosas que se hacen en funciÃ³n de quiÃ©n las hace). La libertad para unos y para otros no la sexualidad sÃ³lo para los protas. Moralista con asteria. (no todas las mujeres tienen que ser luchadoras y eso estÃ¡ bien no se es mÃ¡s tonta por eso). Esta escrito a base de sentimientos (ahi no tengo nada en contra porque es pues como ellas escriben desde el principio). Me hace gracia reseÃ±ar que se repiten escenas y diÃ¡logos a lo largo de sus libros (fricciÃ³n entre una futura pareja, tercero que ayuda, malo que le ha hecho algo a la chica traumatizada,... con los mismas palabras, es decir no repiten ""sentimiento X"" en un mismo libro pero sÃ­ entre libros.
Por otra parte se nota MUCHO que no estÃ¡ la ediciÃ³n de Nocturna, las tramas estÃ¡n sin editar y los textos estÃ¡n sin corregir bien. Una maquetaciÃ³n muy bonita pero si luego me dejas gerundios horribes e inecesarios, verbos no adecuados y descripciones no descriptivas pues que quieres que te diga,...
Han intentado mejorar, pero el problema es que suenan forzadas (o la escribieron en poco tiempo), usan palabras corrientes y muy comunes para expresar las cosas, y luego intentan que queden como ""inspiradas"" estilo poÃ©tico en falsete; no entiendo que empeoren, si les servÃ­a la manera de escribir podÃ­an pulir esa en lugar de inventarse una nueva forma narrativa sobrecargada.
-
Sinceramente parece un encargo editorial a la luz de las cosas que estÃ¡n de moda: chicas feministas de pose y homosexualidad o nuevas sexualidades, tratadas de manera infantil, no sÃ© si es una ""culpa"" o que les falta por crecer mucho. Por otra parte es una disneyficaciÃ³n de Arena Roja con final de trÃ­o, asÃ­ lo digo. Es un libro ""superventas?"" de usar y tirar, lo que estÃ¡ de moda por ahora.
Desde luego ya sÃ© que van a sobrevalorar el libro porque los fans son fans y seguirÃ¡n a Iria hablar de lo que sea, pero imagino que cuando crezcan leerÃ¡n otra cosa y esto puede ser una puerta (o eso quiero creer) a que lean otra cosa o se informen sobre la mitologÃ­a buena.
Cosa que no entiendo y pregunto al mundillo literario es: Â¿Por quÃ© (excepto Mike lIghtwood y otro par de bloggeros) ponÃ©is tan bien a Iria en la red y la seguÃ­s a mansalva y luego la ponÃ©is verde (a Selene no, curiosamente, y creo que es porque es la que tira del carro de verdad) en privado. No hace falta hacer corros en las Celsius o decir lo malos que son los libros en grupos de Whatssap privados pasando capturas incuÃ­do) se pueden hacer crÃ­ticas respetuosas y justificadas como la que creo que he hecho y en eso la defiendo. Decirle a la cara con respeto lo que sea para que puedan mejorar. No podÃ©is decirle ""esta ya puede esperar premios con como escribe"" o ""escribe lo mismo"" o reÃ­ros de los personajes y luego no decÃ­rselo. O decir que si a ""shippeais con tal y cual"" y luego ir diciendo que estÃ¡ liada con megantito a espaldas de futanito o que es lesbiana de pose (esto es lo que mÃ¡s oigo sobre ella y como miembro de la comunidad LGTB no tenÃ©is derecho a decir eso).
Espero que en un futuro elijan buenos lectores 0 y puedan mejorar.

THIS BOOK!! You guys, I thought this book was brilliant! So many great elements all thrown together.
- murder mystery
- high school drama
- secrets, both big and small
- suspicion
I love a murder mystery anyway, but this one was made better as I cared about the 4 kids who were suspects.
The star of the baseball team harbouring a huge secret.
The Prom Queen who has never been able to find herself as a separate person from her long term boyfriend.
The rebel with previous criminal convictions - the obvious suspect.
The goodie two shoes. Surely sheâ€™s never broken the rules?
All 4 end up in detention with Simon Kelleher, the guy who runs a gossip app that ruins reputations with its secrets. All four of them have a secret to hide and would do anything to keep it hidden. But at what cost? Because by the end of detention Simon is dead, but who did it?
â€˜Some people are just too toxic to live.â€™
I was absolutely addicted. I couldnâ€™t put it down until I found out the answer. Plus there are so many tropes that get walked all over. My personal favourite THE GIRL WITH GLASSES GETS THE HOT GUY! This literally never happens in books or films so thank you Karen McManus for including this and not making her take them off â€˜to be prettierâ€™
I loved Addyâ€™s character development too. In the beginning she was just some jockâ€™s girlfriend with no thoughts of her own. By the end of the book she really became her own person and I LOVED THAT.

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction",Meg - A Bookish Affair,"4.5 stars. ""A Column of Fire"" is the third book in Ken Follett's Kingsbridge series. I have not read the first two books but after reading this one, I really want to go back to read those two books as well as some of Follett's other books! That being said, this book works rather well as a standalone book. Standing at over 900 pages, you are in Follett's very capable hands so the pages fly by! This is a historical fiction epic.
The book takes place during a tumultuous time in England's history: the late 1500s and early 1600s. The country is going through a major identity crisis as to whether it is a Catholic or a Protestant country. Should everyone be in the same mold or can they have more freedom? Who is the rightful ruler of the country? Who can that ruler trust?
This was a time period that was familiar to me but what I appreciated is that for the most part, Follett's characters are just on the edge of history. We meet rulers through them like Queen Elizabeth and Mary, Queen of Scots. We see how calculated each move must be for even these edge-of-history characters in order to be on the ""right"" side at the ""right"" time.
This book is action packed and kept me on my toes. In some ways, it reminds me of a soap opera. There's a huge cast but each character has their own unique story. Large casts can often be an issue for me because of the likelihood of characters blending together but Follett really does a good job of creating different storylines that intertwine in surprising ways.

,"Mystery, Thriller, Fiction, Suspense, Crime, Audiobook, Drama, Adult",Jan,"This is a solid mystery that I enjoyed even more than this author's debut novel Summit Lake. Told from different POV's and varying timelines, I found this writing style really helped to create the suspense that made the last 100 pages a complete nail biter for me.
The main protagonist is Livia Cutty-a fellow in forensic pathology, fueled by the disappearance of her younger sister Nicole. It's been over a year since she disappeared from an end of summer beach party, along with a fellow classmate Megan McDonald. Nicole called her cell phone that night, and it's Livia's biggest regret that she ignored this call, not wanting to get involved in Nicole's late night drama.
When the body of a young man found floating in the water ends up on her table, Livia discovers a possible connection to her sister in the unlikeliest of ways. This is the spark that builds and pushes Livia to start digging for more answers on what happened the night her sister was taken. She reaches out for help from another unlikely source-Megan, who managed to escape after 2 weeks of captivity.
While I really liked Livia's character, I felt that she read like an established career woman already in her mid thirties, not someone in her mid twenties. She was too calm, too wise, and I felt a bit too emotionally detached to have been so successful in her detective work right from the start. Part of that could come from the ease in which she was given access to medical records or was able to get people to give up secrets so easily. This seemed to be a bit of a stretch for me.
There were a couple of other side plots I would have liked more information or closure on as well. (view spoiler)
Outside of this, I really found myself immersed in the mystery, trying different characters on for size as the antagonist, and was happy to have been mislead many times over. I felt the forensic research done to give Livia the credibility needed to lead this story was also well done. I am by no means an expert in this field, but the details felt credible. (Maybe a bit heavy handed with the smells of death throughout)
I highly recommend this to all mystery lovers, you won't be disappointed!

My Review:
The Wicked City was an intriguing and enthralling conundrum. Written from a dual POV in two distinct timelines spaced 74 years apart and involved the same building in New York City. I was deeply embroiled in the story and the mystery continued to grow and thicken, I was never sure if, how, or when the two stories were going to sync or mesh together, or even how the characters were going to be related. Both female characters in the different storylines were experiencing a period of great upheaval and were fraught with distress. Both storylines featured mounting tension, impending peril, risks, disappointments, betrayals, and treachery. While reading, I experienced a sense of inner conflict similar to arriving at an accident scene and at once feeling fearful to look yet also pulled by a powerful magnet and unable to look away. I was quickly hooked by the elaborately detailed and quirky writing style as well as the premise and was instantly sucked down the rabbit hole and remained there, as despite my increasing befuddlement - I could not put my kindle down. Ms. Williams maintained two tightly written and suspense-filled tales within one book that kept me on edge, curious, totally invested and completely engaged.

this is gonna be just pure reader response here, with no attempt made towards any objective assessment or critical analysis. when it comes to bardugoâ€™s fairy tales, iâ€™m just a box full of puppies and all i can do is grin.
iâ€™d read three of these stories before this collection was published, as free tor shorts. i reviewed â€˜em here, if you really do need to have your critical analysis beast fed, or if you just want the links to where you can read the stories for free:
The Too-Clever Fox
The Witch of Duva
Little Knife
even though iâ€™ve read dozens more since then, those three stories are still top-ranked in my â€œfree tor short hall of fame.â€ they are the perfect kind of fairytale - not cheesy or gentle, not dark and edgy just to shock or subvert, but â€¦ honest. they are as close to feeling â€œrealâ€ as a fairytale can get, in their beating hearts and blood beneath the magic. coming across them, i felt like iâ€™d discovered something exquisite - it felt like a gift, like pure magic and wonder handcrafted for me. and when i heard this was going to be published and realized iâ€™d already read half of the book, it is a testament to just how good those stories are that i didnâ€™t feel a scrap of disappointment. i only felt, â€œoh, good - now they can truly be mine, away from my computer.â€
and now they are. the three stories i hadnâ€™t read were every bit as good as the ones i had, and the artwork - itâ€™s phenomenal. as each story progresses, it grows its own illustrated borders page by page simultaneously across the verso/recto, until the images connect triumphantly, or devastatingly, followed by a single, full-page illustration serving as an explosive â€œTHE END.â€ the illustrations are quite cheeky in their details, too, which makes them perfect companions to these little story bombs.
sheâ€™s so good at these that as much as i enjoy her longer books, if she decided to devote herself entirely to fleshing out her imaginary lands through folklore like this, i would applaud her choices without reservation.
maybe i will write more at a later date, but for now, just this happy cheer.
also, i'm really glad i have a signed copy, otherwise this page would feel like it was missing something

When this one came up for review, I almost passed on it. I am not entirely sure whyâ€¦..maybe because it was up for review in September and I wasnâ€™t ready to start thinking about anything Christmas related until at least November.
Or maybe it was because it was a collaboratively written novel, or that the title wasnâ€™t grabbing me. I donâ€™t know, for some reason I almost passed but I am terribly glad that I didnâ€™t pass on this one!
Let me just say, I loved this novel. Itâ€™s a novel written basically in all letter form which made for a super fast read that was hard to put down. The whole time I kept thinking â€œjust one more letterâ€ and next thing I know I was on a different year in the war! So super fast and because of the letters I felt personally connected to the characters in a unique way.
I normally donâ€™t read a lot of books with different authors because sometimes it just doesnâ€™t work. There is clearly a different voice or style and for me it doesnâ€™t always flow well. However, for this book it was a home run. I loved how different yet familiar each of the letters were. The two authors nailed the different perspectives and gave Evie and Tom very unique yet similar voices. If this book hadnâ€™t been written in letter form, then I am not sure that it would have worked as well.
So as I said, I loved it, but that doesnâ€™t mean that it was flawless. For me, I felt like the last two parts (last two years of the war) were rushed and not nearly the same attention to detail as the other parts/years or letters. The ending felt rushed and I am not sure that they knew how to wrap things up. I felt like so many pages and letters were dedicated to developing the romantic tension between Evie and Tom and then toward the end it just happened too fast. There was only really two letters between the two that really committed their love to one another and that was too few for me.
Also I felt like it too Evie way too long to enter the War herself and when she did her time there was too fast and there wasnâ€™t enough insight through her letters to convince me that she was ever really changed or had really seen anything at all. All this ground work had been laid for her to go to the front and when it happened we only had a few letters that were short and rushed. So I felt like I needed more on that. It almost seemed like an after thought.
All criticism aside though, this was a fantastic story. I loved the research and knowledge that went into the time period and history of the war. It was fascinating to read and clearly the authors did a ton of research on WWI to give it a realistic ring and it was well wroth it!
This novel isnâ€™t really about â€˜Christmasâ€™ so the title is a little misleading but if you are looking for a war time romance with characters that you will no doubt fall in love with, check out this intimate novel full of letters!

I loved this book. It was the perfection combination of historical fiction and romance. I'm glad the authors decided to write this in letter format, because they allowed the character's personalities to really shine.
Evie, the female MC was spunky, and I liked her from her very first letter. I also loved the character, Alice. I felt as if Alice and I would be best friends because we are pretty much the same person.
As I was reading Last Christmas in Paris, I couldn't help but draw similarities between this story and The Notebook. The plots are completely different, but the character's personalities felt the same.
Don't expect to read this book and be filled with holiday cheer...it may have the word ""Christmas"" in the title, but it isn't a lighthearted read. It sheds light on a very sad time in history, and it will leave you needing tissues.
But the authors did a wonderful job, and I will be reading this book again, for sure. (less)",Positif
,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Paranormal, Christian Fiction, Christian",Jennifer,"The description doesn't really indicate it, but these novels are HEAVILY religious along the Christian/Catholic lines. Things are things said along the lines of you can't do the missions assigned you alone, you can only do them through Him. Or any glory earned is not your glory, it is God's. A lot of the main point of the novel is to trust in God and believe in him and not what you think is best.
If that does not appeal to you, stay far away from this novel.
That said, I am indifferent to it, so it neither increased or decreased my rating. I enjoyed the novel and stayed up far too late finishing it, but the romances relies heavily on the characters not communicating with each other and a very unbalanced love triangle. I also thought the main character was SO very slow to catch on to a few things and the explanation was, God didn't you want you to figure it out yet. That one did bother me as a plot device.

,"Fantasy, Historical, Young Fiction, Paranormal",Jenny Baker,"I donâ€™t know what to say about this one. It had a fantastic start, but the last hundred pages was a chore to read. I actually sat this down for almost a week before I picked it back up to try to finish it.
The begin felt like a weird, creepy horror story, which I loved, but then the novel takes an unexpected bad turn. The spirit possession plot is set aside and the focus is more about the war, family secrets, and staying in the kingâ€™s good graces. Thereâ€™s also a betrayal angle. For a large chunk of the novel, it felt like I was reading a historical fiction novel â€” taking place in the mid-1600s â€” but I was expecting more of a horror novel with just some historical elements.
If this entire novel had been like the first fifty pages, this would have been a four-star read. It had the right pacing and intrigue until it slowed down and changed directions. There were some nice twists, and parts that I thought were foreshadowing turned out to be misdirects. I did enjoy that aspect of it, because it kept me guessing.
Overall, Iâ€™m disappointed. Itâ€™s definitely not my favorite Hardinge novel. I'm not sure if I misread the summary or if the summary was misleading. If youâ€™ve never read a Frances Hardinge novel, I suggest that you begin with Cuckoo Song.

Only few books can shake me. Allegedly is one of them.
After I finished this compelling novel, I needed some time to process everything that was going on in the book, as well as calm myself so I could understand my feelings.
Reading this, you probably think Iâ€™m exaggerating.
If I was you, Iâ€™d probably think the same.
But I am telling the truth. Sometimes we donâ€™t know how weâ€™re going to react to a certain book, and sometimes our reactions can surprise us.
Going into this story, I knew it would be difficult for me. I was even aware how disturbing it was.
You probably hear about Allegedly, as one of novels written in own voices, one that was praised in â€œreading diversityâ€ movement (if thatâ€™s a movement, Iâ€™m not 100% sure), the book that is important to read.
First of all, I agree with the statement how it is important for this book to be read, and for authorâ€™s voice to be heard.
This is one hugely important, disturbing book that represents not only people of color, but minority that we donâ€™t get to read often about â€“ teenagers in group home.
Honestly, I am afraid how Iâ€™m going to sound when I say this, but I will say it anyway: this novel reminded me how happy my life is. When I reflect and compare it to lives like ones I read about in this novel, to teenagers who yes, committed crimes during their lives, but are still alive and have to live with invisible â€œScarlet letterâ€ that follows them every where they go, without support of their families, in poverty and with someone else deciding about everything in their life, I understand how privileged I actually am.
And once again, I used the word I am really not a fan of, but there is no other word to say it better.
The story is told in first person, following Maryâ€™s POV.
Beside Maryâ€™s narration (and I have to state that Mary is one of the best narrators I had a pleasure to read about), there are bunch of newspaper articles, police interviews, excerpts from doctorâ€™s papers and other similar stuff.
Reading Allegedly was thought provoking and emotional experience.
It definitely wasnâ€™t easy.
Some scenes were violent and disturbing, some were harder to understand, some were extremely sad, but what hit me the most was how everyone underestimated Mary all the time.
I rooted for her, even though she never stated if she did it, if she killed the baby. She said she did, allegedly.
But yet, you as a reader donâ€™t believe she would do such a thing. She does not seem like that kind of person.
The writing style is amazing, and I simply can not believe this is a debut novel.
One more thing Iâ€™d like to emphasize is the role of the State (here I mean criminal justice system and state foster care).
Maryâ€™s (and other girlsâ€™) destiny depended so much on those two, that it feels like the State has itâ€™s own personality.
There is one more thing we need to discuss: the last chapter.
I tried and tried to decide whether I like how this story ended.
At fist I was shocked, but resolved that I liked it.
Now, after some thinking, I wish the story ended differently.
Why?
Because, even though I understand why the writer chose to end the story the way she did, I canâ€™t help but feel that some messages delivered through the story were (partly) erased with that conclusion.
Fun fact: When doing my research, I found out that this book was inspired by true event that happened in 2012, when 10 years old girl was charged with manslaughter of a three month old baby.

,"Mystery, Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction",Pouting Always,"As war is declared in Britain, Maisie Dobbs' finds herself investigating the death of an Belgian expat living in England. Dr. Francesca Thomas who works in intelligence and is original Belgian hires her on the part of the Belgian embassy but as Maisie digs deeper into the case she begins to wonder what Dr.Thomas is hiding from her. The longer she investigates the more bodies start to pile up, all Belgian expats who came to England during WWI and settled down there. While trying to figure out the thread connecting the murder victims Maisie must also help out at her family home when a little girl name Anna is staying but has trouble telling anyone anything about where she's from. This was my first Maisie Dobbs and I don't think choosing to start on the thirteenth book was the best. I actually hadn't know it was a series. The mystery was solid but I thought the ending was kind of dumb, (view spoiler), it just felt like the whole murder spree was unwarranted. I also found the whole story line with Anna really boring, not sure why but I just didn't care what was going to happen to the little girl, I really just wanted to know why people were being killed for leaving a country as refugees years ago. The writing was pretty good and the book seemed more historical accurate than most. Though the book was a little dry for my tastes, not the biggest fan of political conspiracies and intelligence agencies or pending wars, I do think someone who likes historical fiction or mysteries could really like this one, especially someone more picky about accuracy. Also maybe if I had read the other books I'd care more about the other characters but most of the time I just got annoyed when the plot moved away from the investigation.

,"Romance, Young Adult, Contemporary, New Adult, Fiction",Aestas Book Blog,"So many secrets in this house. And yet, the one secret I should have told years ago is the one Iâ€™ve kept the quietest.
Colleen Hoover is one of best authors I've ever read and her books are always sitting at the top of my recommendations lists for every kind of reader! Her books are absorbing, her characters are endearing, and each new story she writes is unique, relatable, and thought provoking. She has a very distinctive writing style that I absolutely love, I also respect and admire her as a person -- the charity she has started is incredible, and each time she announces a new book, I count down the days until I'm able to read it.
Without Merit is unlike anything she's written before. She returned to her YA roots with this one -- more in the vein of Slammed and Hopeless -- and yet this story is still very different even than those. It's a slow building, slow burning story that eventually takes you completely by surprise. The most important thing to keep in mind when reading this book is that perspective changes everything. The story doesn't tell, it shows you. It's real, raw, and painful. And yet also deeply heart-warming and healing. It conveys a powerful message that tackles tough subjects with grace. It's relevant and relatable. It's a book I'd want to give to every teen, but at the same time I believe everyone would enjoy it. The story takes you right into the dark, but also brings you back and leaves you smiling.
â€œNot every mistake deserves a consequence.
Sometimes the only thing it deserves is forgiveness.â€
The Voss family is anything but normal. They live in a repurposed church, newly baptized Dollar Voss. The once cancer-stricken mother lives in the basement, the father is married to the motherâ€™s former nurse, the little half-brother isnâ€™t allowed to do or eat anything fun, and the eldest siblings are irritatingly perfect. Then, thereâ€™s Merit.
Merit Voss collects trophies she hasnâ€™t earned and secrets her family forces her to keep. While browsing the local antiques shop for her next trophy, she finds Sagan. His wit and unapologetic idealism disarm and spark renewed life into herâ€”until she discovers that heâ€™s completely unavailable. Merit retreats deeper into herself, watching her family from the sidelines, when she learns a secret that no trophy in the world can fix.
Fed up with the lies, Merit decides to shatter the happy family illusion that sheâ€™s never been a part of before leaving them behind for good. When her escape plan fails, Merit is forced to deal with the staggering consequences of telling the truth and losing the one boy she loves.
Poignant and powerful, Without Merit explores the layers of lies that tie a family together and the power of love and truth.
Other than the blurb, I don't really want to post too much about what the story is about. Colleen Hoover is one of the authors who has fully gained my trust over the years and for me just knowing that she wrote the book is enough to make me feel confident diving into the story blind. I would strongly encourage you to do the same.
Without Merit is a quietly powerful read. It's a slow build that didn't really keep my heart racing as I read, but I believe that was intentional. I don't think it was meant to be an angsty style of read. I think it was meant to be more of a fictionalized reflection of something closer to real life. Sometimes the things that influence a person's choices the most come quietly. This isn't the type of story where one huge, cataclysmic event changes everything. It's the opposite. It's a butterfly effect times ten. It's the result of many smaller events that all together build a storm.
No one would be able to determine from the outside of our house that our family of seven includes an atheist, a home wrecker, an ex-wife suffering from a severe case of agoraphobia, and a teenage girl whose weird obsession borders on necrophilia.
No one would be able to determine any of that from inside our house, either. Weâ€™re good at keeping secrets in this family.
The first chapter really sets the tone for the whole book. You're introduced to Merit's character -- her hopes and frustrations, and then there's this one moment where you suddenly realize that nothing is as it seems.
â€œSo many people dream of living in a house with a white picket fence. Little do they know, thereâ€™s no such thing as a perfect family, no matter how white the picket fence is.â€
Everything about her life was unusual, odd, different than normal -- like the Adams family of small town America -- and as the story goes on you could really see how much she suffered from a loss of identity. When you think about 'child neglect', your mind often jumps to extreme - abusive - cases. But it can manifest in so many ways. Sometimes a simple lack of attention can be enough to make a child feel so invisible that they lose their sense of self-worth.
I donâ€™t matter here, either. If I dropped out of life, just like I dropped out of school, everyoneâ€™s lives would go on.
With or without Merit.
This story has many layers to it and they build. Like I said, it's the butterfly effect many times over. The writing is brilliant. And it builds so quietly that you don't even notice that a storm is brewing until the moment where everything just explodes. Implodes. Everything is turned on its end and as the reader you're RIGHT THERE with it.
I have Utahâ€™s secret.
I have my fatherâ€™s secret.
My motherâ€™s secret.
Honorâ€™s secret.
Luckâ€™s secret.
I donâ€™t want any of them anymore!
Maybe if I let all the secrets out, they wouldnâ€™t make me feel like drowning anymore.
Perspective. You'll keep coming back to that theme throughout the book. And when you're finished it, you'll look back and just realize how much perspective matters. The Voss Family was brimming with secrets. But the thing with secrets is that they aren't always what they seem. Sometimes the villain isn't the bad guy. And as the quote at the top of the blurb says, â€œNot every mistake deserves a consequence. Sometimes the only thing it deserves is forgiveness.â€
Perspective changes everything.
The story shows you every detail. It doesn't tell you what to think. It makes you draw your own conclusions. Without meaning to, you can't even help but judge situations. But then it shows you this one missing piece that makes you realize how wrong you were. It's very cleverly written and eye opening.
Itâ€™s incredible how much better a kiss can make you feel, right?â€
I nod. â€œSo incredible.â€
His thumb brushes my cheek, then his satisfied grin falls into a pointed stare. â€œThatâ€™s exactly why I wonâ€™t do it again, Merit. You need to fall in love with yourself first.â€
And OMG OMG OMG! There is a BRILLIANT bookstore scene!!!!!!!! I don't want to spoil anything but if you've been a longtime fan of this author and follow her, you'll get a serious kick out of that scene :D
As I said, this book is unlike anything else Colleen Hoover has written. It's a new direction for her and, like all her other books, it's a strong and stellar read I whole-heartedly recommend. If I had to describe it, I'd say it's very much like It Ends With Us in feeling, but instead this book is targeted at the teen age range rather than adult. But again, I do believe this is a book that everyone will enjoy! It's easily one of my favorite books of the year!

,"Fantasy, Young Adult ",Katherine Paschal,"Lady Annabelle's parents were murdered one night and when Annabelle was told the news, all her color fell off of her- literally, fell off until the grass until all that remained was gray. And then everyone forgot that Annabelle even existed and she was completely invisible. But strangely, when she touched something, the color would fall from the item making it just as colorless and forgettable. But Dylan the stable boy can still see her and he resolves to help her any way he can, regardless of the danger it puts him in.
â€‹I think the concept for this story and ultimately this world was really cool and unique, with many Gods and Magicians and the different classes of people and curses. I would have loved to learn more about the pilgrimages and the dynamic of the Magicians in the society overall, as well as what the magicians were actually capable of and how they got to be so powerful. The hierarchy was unique and had a lot of potential for conflict and magic, which peaked my interest. I would be super interested to read a backstory â€‹of the iconaclasts and the magician history (every time the past of iconoclasts was hinted at my interest was 100% peaked).
Unfortunately, I was super confused a majority of the story. It was really hard to follow the plot and all the small nuances of the world, at times I gave up on trying to figure everything out and just go with the flow and hope that things would work out at the end. Some did, some didn't, some were never explained at all (I guess just facts I was suppose to accept?). I liked Dylan as a character and empathized with him (but the whole spiel about him being a pseudo ladies man was ridiculous and 100% not needed for the story), but I did not really care for Annabelle and her snooty ways as well as Tony and his selfishness and crazy paranoia.
I am not a huge fan of the narrator, she had her skill in creating very distinct voices so there was no doubt as to who was talking, but I did not really like all the voices. Annabelle and Dylan were well done characters, but Tony sounded like a drunk snob most of the time and the Monk voices were so drawn out, scratchy and low it was hard to understand their words- I got the gist of their menacing tone, so that was a plus, but the actual words at times I could not catch. I think I may have enjoyed the story more if I had read the book instead of listening to it because I found myself disconnecting at times, completely zoned out and unsure what I last heard so I had to rewind a lot.
The ending was the best part of the story for me, I wanted to cheer Annabelle on for her audacity and how everything was playing out. There were some loose ends that did not completely wrap up, but things seemed to be well enough resolved that I didn't feel like I was missing anything important. I felt like this was a standalone book, but after reading the book I discovered that there is a prequel (not sure if this will be ongoing or not). But there is definitely potential for more. This is the second book I have read from this author and I have learned that she is able to create completely new, unique worlds which I appreciate.

""There's not always weakness in forgiveness.""
I had read a lot of mixed reviews on Val's an Ashton's story, so I went in with low expectations and an open mind. And while I didn't love it, I did enjoy these two characters.
Concourse is the story of gay instagram star Ashton, or A Town. Known for being a partier and slutty after a sex tape from his youth. Val's mom used to work for Ashton's family, so the two boys grew up together and formed a special bond. Constantly in and out of each other's lives, the two begin spending more time together, and feelings get mixed.
I wanted to like this book a lot, I really did. But if there's one thing I hate, it's wishy washy characters and both Val AND Ashton fit the bill. Well it also didn't help that the first 20% of the book all that seemed to happen was the characters driving around and just kind of not doing much. The plot didn't move forward at all until 50% in.
I liked Val and Ash as individuals, it was their actions toward each other that drove me crazy. I would liken this couple/book to Hard Wired by Megan & Santino, and Rowdy by Jay Crownover. By this I mean when one character finally made up their mind about what they wanted, the other character starts to backtrack. IT'S SO FRUSTRATING!!! And not in an angsty good way.
I really liked the self journey Ashton went on to improve his quality of life and to give a good impact in the world. Val's journey was more about giving up on old things that didn't seem to matter anymore, just letting go.
I still love Santino, I'll read anything the man writes. This one just wasn't a winner for me.

Even though this book has 346 pages in it's hardcover edition it felt like a much shorter read because it was just that good!

I had heard of the color indigo and knew the color came from a plant but never knew it was an actual flower grown in South Carolina. At times I just wanted to scream at the injustice of things I had read and I actually had to take a short break from reading at the unfairness of things that had made me sad. The story contained within is based on a true events and historical documents. Brilliantly fascinating. I will be looking for more books by this new to me author,Natasha Boyd.

There are so many things I loved about this book: strong female friendship, character growth, gorgeous locations, no insta-love. Plus it was an enjoyable read. Itâ€™s the perfect book to take you on a vacation without actually going on vacation.
There was a lot that I liked about The Key to Everything and once things got going, I couldnâ€™t put it down. The things I loved largely outweighed the things I didnâ€™t like and I wouldnâ€™t mind rereading this book in the near future. If I had to rate it out of 5 stars, it would be a solid 4 stars.

,"Fiction, Mystery, Thriller, crime",Dianne,"Do you like dark and gritty suspense novels that threaten to make even the strongest of constitutions a little faint? How would you feel if satanic cults were blamed to be involved as one disturbed ward of the system is witnessed killing his foster parents? What if the witnesses were young teens, traumatized and unsure of what they witnessed? Were they having a mass episode of hysteria? Were they truly watching a satanic ritual in progress or were they so confused, they were unable to differentiate fact from fiction?
Feel something vile crawling under your skin, feel morbid curiosity and dread fear that this could really happen in a society as lost and unstable as ours can be.
Dan Chaon will take us into a world beyond our control, beyond our comfort zones and into the world of ILL WILL where the villain is actually a victim himself and may truly NOT be the villain after all. As this tale is told, oen man will relive the times he remembers as a horror, after he hears his foster brother will be released from his life sentence, because guess what, he didnâ€™t do the crime. So who did? Will Dustinâ€™s brother Rusty seek revenge?
As Dustin gets roped into another cold case by one of his patients, he finds himself tumbling headlong into the dark abyss of murder, mystery and strange tie-ins to his brotherâ€™s case.

Blush for Me is the third installment in the Fusion Series and follows the story of Mac and Kat. For wine bar manager, Kat, there isnâ€™t much that scares her. Between her strong and impressive IQ and devotion to her friends and job, she is a total no-nonsense type of gal. But when Kat finds herself on a flight for a wine tour, she quickly discovers that there is one thing that could bring her to her kneesâ€¦.Flying. As luck would have it though, she was graced with the best possible flight mate, Mac. He calms her down and gives her the strength she needs to make it through the flight. Before they know it, the flight is over, leaving them parting waysâ€¦Of course, fate had other plans for these two. When they find themselves on the same wine tour, they spend an unforgettable, no strings attached week together. Their connection is intense and undeniable. Neither one of them can get the other out of their heads and when fate decides to intervene one more time, Mac and Kat canâ€™t stay away from one another leaving them with no other option but to see where their amazing chemistry will take themâ€¦.
Overall, I think Blush for Me is a wonderful addition to the Fusion Series. This story is incredibly well written and entertaining. The characters are a lot of fun and they just feel like youâ€™ve known them forever. You canâ€™t help but fall for them the moment you meet them and just see where the story is going to go. I loved spending time with Kat and her friends. They are the type of girlfriends that any woman would be lucky to have in their life. And of course, I loved Kat and Mac. Their chemistry was solid and strong. They were the perfect balance and I just couldnâ€™t get enough of the pull between the two of them.
Blush for Me was a fabulous read, from beginning to end. The story was captivating and filled with the sexy and sweet romance that I have come to love from this author. It was perfectly balanced with a little bit of suspense and mystery along the way. Blush for Me gave me everything that I was looking for and I canâ€™t wait to get my hands on the next book in this series!

Yeah, how about no.
I don't think this author and I are a match. I'm not sure I will enjoy her books. I was so frustrated by the fact Molly was basically basing her self worth on her friends attempts to get her a boyfriend it overshadowed the rest of the plot.
Not only that, but I felt this book was incredibly childish. I didn't enjoy the writing and felt myself cringing at the writing, especially the overuse of emojis in text (which had to be described, no thanks).
I could see what this book was trying to achieve, but for me it fell short. This could be because I couldn't remember who the hell was actually related to Molly - my fault, I know.
I also can't comment on the fat girl rep throughout this book, but from what I could see it seemed slightly harmful. The fact that she's relying on a boy for her to be happy (resulting in a bloody love triangle) is ridiculous. You're all beautiful. Fat, skinny, average (I say this to more so cover the people who are, occurring to science, the right weight for their height). It shouldn't matter. I've had a shit tonne of unrequited crushes and never have I let it impact who I am as an individual. I'm sure everyone has at least had an unrequited crush or not taken the risk when they thought someone was cute. The whole thing pissed me off.
For a positive, though, I will say the final chapter warmed my heart (took the whole book) and Molly's mum's were incredibly sweet. There is also a bunch of diversity, but diversity is definitely something which should be included anyway so I'm not giving any extra stars for that. (less)",Negatif

It's been a year since Kai Mori's life changed. After their once best friend disappeared, the Four Horsemen tried to live a normal life while staying vigilant of possible threat. When a new lead emerged of their enemy's whereabouts, Kai knew he had to take the opportunity before it slipped between his fingers.
Nik Banks grew up believing the world is a bad place. She did everything she could to survive and that included getting close to the enemy. But when things became personal, she had to decide where her loyalty lies.
It's been a while since book 1 came out and I'm glad that we finally get Kai's story. I was happy that the book started quite dark, but it mellowed out by the end of the book.
He was in complete control of me. He knew it, and heâ€™d just proved it.
I've like Kai since book 1. He had a darkness in him that he consciously tried to control. I also like that while he could be hard, yet he had a certain level of gentleness.
I was what Kai said I was. A tool. Something others used.
I usually love unlikable characters. Unfortunately, Banks didn't get on that list. I just couldn't warm up to her skewed perspective.
There is one major issue in this book for me. This is supposed to be Kai's book, but Damon outshined him by far. Damon's role was too significant to stay in the background. Also the book is very long and yet the ending still felt incomplete.
Hideaway is a story of loyalty and righting the wrongs. It would appeal to fans of romantic suspense.

The Japanese characters in my teaser, the first one is ""hide"", the second one is ""chase"". I hope Google didn't failed me lol!

As a female software programmer with a love of 1980s culture, I was very intrigued when I heard about this novel. Even though the basic synopsis sounded somewhat superficial, I knew needed to read the novel immediately!
Essentially, the story revolves around a group of teenage boys on a quest to acquire a highly desired porno magazine. Yet, the novel manages to hit on a deeper emotional level while still providing a fun reading experience. The plot was, admittedly, fairly simplistic and predictable. I was able to correctly predict the majority of the plot developments, although the author did manage to take a few turns that I was not expecting.
Despite the ages of the characters, I would classify this as adult fiction rather than young adult. The story is told through reflective narration, with the main character recounting his childhood experiences from a present day perspective. The 1980s references will be most meaningful to the readers who actually experienced that decade, although the author keeps the technology and media accessible for younger generations. This story would appeal to a wide audience, including teenage readers who typically read young adult fiction.
The characters felt genuine and fairly well developed. At times, the boys were stupid and insensitive. In other words, they read like realistic fourteen-year-old boys, with all the adolescent immaturity of those teenage years. I really loved the lead female character, who was smart and capable, yet still vulnerable. The plot does heavily feature a budding romance, so readers must be okay with reading a story about young love.
Other reviewers have compared book has been compared to both Ready Player One, Eleanor & Park and Stranger Things.These comparisons are primarily due to the 1980s references in all these stories. Other than the nostalgic factor, this novel is quite different and should not be unfairly compared to other 1980s media. Personally, I loved the infusion of pop culture and coding references, which added a level of nerdy fan-girling to my reading experience.
While not exactly ground-breaking, I still really enjoyed reading this sweet coming-of-age novel. The writing was very accessible so I flew through the chapters quickly. I would recommend this novel to readers looking for a entertaining, funny romance story with some fantastic, nostalgic 1980s vibes.

,"Romance, Contemporary, Contemporary Romance, Humor, Funny",BrookeNoWhiskey,"There is something very unique about a book that asks you to acknowledge that you are wrong, and then strives to educate you as to why. There are a multitude of misconceptions flying around the central issues in Beard in Mind and the characters within. The word I would use to describe this book would be illuminating.
As a fan of Penny Reid and the Winston Brothers series (as well as the Knitting in the City series), I thought I knew Shelly Sullivan. I thought I understood her surly disposition and her indifferent ways. I really thought I knew Beau Winstonâ€”the charming flirt with a strong family support system. I was complacent in the idea of their story because I thought I knew where everything was going. But I was wrong. In typical Penny Reid fashion, there is no formula. There is no standard trope, and there are a few curveballs thrown along the way.
Throughout the story we get to know the real Beauford Winston and the real Shelly Sullivan. And these are some of the most complex characters that Reid has written. We learn about the inner turmoil faced by both main characters. Beauâ€”the face of the easy-going twin whose charm is likened to a habit formed and solidified over time. Shellyâ€”the woman so consumed with fear that her outward appearance reflects none of her emotions.
We are also shown the unexpected inner desires of these characters and that is where the relationship begins to form. Itâ€™s how these two can move past the antagonism and conflict to form a lasting bond and partnership. Beau is ready for commitment after seeing the transformation of his siblings and their significant others. Shelly is similarly motivated by her family. She is desperate to confront her fears and anxiety head-on in order to play a more prominent role in the lives of her loved ones.
Beau and Shelly not only surprise the reader, but they surprise each other, too.
Penny weaves her unique storytelling in a way that makes these characters known. Itâ€™s obvious and imperative that she explain Shellyâ€™s struggle and behavior. That she corrects assumptions and generalizations about Shellyâ€™s actions. Beau goes from a simple character with a singular focus to a layered and complicated individual.
I loved this book for the characters and the journey they take. I loved the way Beau and Shelly come together and find their way. I love that my preconceived notions were quietly broken.
This is a story about what itâ€™s really like to love someoneâ€”to support them, to be their partner. I think this book has the most heart of any Penny Reid book. While that is a difficult quantity to measure, itâ€™s more of something you just have to feel. And Beard in Mind made me feel a lot.

When I was reading this book, I was as broken as Matthew! Iâ€™m not a crier but I cried! This story pushed me so hard and took me out of my comfort zone. And you should take the authorâ€™s note seriously (in the blurb). I still hate the incubi king and Tarrick, even Liliy for not supporting his father. But I loved Samantha (she is funny) and Jet and Thank you, Jex Lane, for fulfilling my wish! Now I have another one! Could you please give me a reason to love Tarrick (or hate him less) in the next installment?! And please in his POV?! I really love to know whatâ€™s in his mind, maybe that way I could understand him better! Heâ€™s like a puzzle to me, the one that I canâ€™t find out about! I want him to care about Matthew (more). I know he has feelings for Matthew but doesnâ€™t want to let himself show it (or maybe Iâ€™m wrong) but I want to see them! I want to see his concern and his happiness for Matthew and I want to feel them! I still love Devak and want him to be with Matthew butâ€¦ Itâ€™s rare to me to read a series in a row but this series was really addictive, intriguing and compelling that I couldnâ€™t not read it! It was well-written, a bit slow and so exciting! And I should say this book was different with the two previous ones. Told in single POV (except the prologue and epilogue, they were the kingâ€™s POV), 3rd person. Itâ€™s the third installment in the ""Beautiful Monsters"" series and must be read in order.

,"Christian Fiction, Historical, Romance, Westerns",Sally,"Too Far Down is the third book in The Cimarron Legacy series. It starts off with an explosion and doesnâ€™t let up. If you enjoy inspirational westerns, youâ€™ll love this story. Mary Connealyâ€™s blend of faith, humor, and romance will draw you into her cowboy stories.
Cole Boden has been to Harvard, but his fatherâ€™s last will and testament states he must live at the ranch for a full year or forfeit it. Heâ€™s now running his familyâ€™s mine operation. Until trouble finds his family again. Someone aims to take control of their vast land grant near the Cimarron River. With these explosions he wants to stay in one of the cabins at the mine, but canâ€™t since thatâ€™s not on the ranch.
Melanie Blake, a close family friend and in line to inherit her fatherâ€™s ranch, volunteers to stay in one of the cabins at the mine. Can he let her do that? Will she be safe? What if sheâ€™s put in harmâ€™s way when his family is attacked again?
Cole has to come to terms with living back east or staying in the west. What will he decide? If he decides back east, Mel wonâ€™t go back with him. She loves ranching. While trying to figure out who is targeting his family, will he figure out where his heart wants to be?
Too Far Down is full of romantic comedy, suspense, and the pull of legacy, love, and family. If you havenâ€™t read the other books in the series, this story can be read as a stand-alone. But youâ€™ll want to read the others to see whatâ€™s happened.
I love the cover for this story as it is a mix of what happens in the story. The characters drew me into the story. Their imperfections and Coleâ€™s attitude of not being quite sure what God would have him do made them realistic. Her descriptions of the mining accident and the landscape made me feel like I was right there.

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Young Adult, Romance, Fantasy",Sara Cardon,"Refuge for Masterminds has so many swoony moments, humor, and a wonderful finale. Jane and Alexander are great leading characters. The story begins with the two of them together, right off the bat.
Lady Jane is proper and polished. I love how much like a governess she is, and how she's teased about it. She doesn't trust anyone enough to share her secrets or self doubts.
Alexander is a sweet American blundering the rules of Regency England. He's an inventor and his enthusiasm for his work is fantastic. He and Jane banter over their differences.
""All right, Lady Jane, what are you up to? I see cogs turning in that dangerous little head of yours.""
I love how he teases Jane, but is protective if anyone says unkind things to her.
""'Who? Who else says you try their patience?' He demands this, as if no one else on earth has the right to say such things to me except for him. As if he will call out the blackguard...""
Love it! These two are so fun, especially trying to work together.
I enjoy the period details. I appreciate the way the girls and the guys work together (and Jane rolls her eyes if people only notice the guys' efforts, haha). The sisterhood of the girls in the school is sweet. There are fantastic (and funny) new characters, in addition to seeing my favorites again. Beautifully told. This is a fun adventure of wits, wills, courage and love.

I knew parts of this book took place in the SF Bay Area... parts in New York....plus I had read that the author, Nina LaCour, lives in Oakland, Ca. I was 'jazzed'. How bad could this book be? NOT BAD AT ALL FOR ME!!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!
I read this book slow over 3 days. ----The story takes place over 3 days too!
It's a tiny book. It could be read in one or two hours, but that's not how I read it. I knew early on that I didn't want to say goodbye to MARIN!!! I didn't want to leave her... I just wanted to be there - with this young girl as much as possible. I wanted to tell her ---""I understand the loneliness- the grief - the fears - the emptiness. I related to her and her situation.
THIS STORY BROUGHT UP PAST MEMORIES for me.....
.....of the summer between my Senior Year in High School and College
.....of living alone with only my mother -passing each other like distant roommates.
......years of living in an apt. -- threadbare- just my mother and I.
......I thought of David Vann's book, ""Aquarium"", ... even though the stories are different. This book brought back feelings I had from that powerful book, too.
......I remembered a time - living in Oakland - around the time Martin Luther King died...of not knowing where my mother was for a couple of days - scared and worried.
......I thought about my grandparents and their pawnshop store on Broadway Ave. in Oakland. I thought about my private time with my 'Gramps' before he died. I was only 7 when he died of a stroke - two years after my dad died of a heart attack.
......I thought about all the many kids that grow up with with only 1 caretaker-adult. ( especially an only child).
......I also thought of our own older daughter. ( a sweet happy memory). There was reference to the play ""The Turning of the Screw"", in ""We Are Okay"".
Our daughter played the leading female role at the San Jose Rep. She was 12 years old. It was her first equity performance -- phenomenal show -- performances were extended beyond the standard 6 week run.
........I 'still' wish I didn't have to say goodbye to Marin. I like Mabel too!!
To me .... this is close to a perfect book! It may not be for everyone- but for some of us it allows our souls to sing!!!

""It was a summer of trying not to think too deeply. A summer of pretending that the end wasn't coming. A summer I got lost in time, when I rarely knew what day it was, rarely cared about the hour. A summer so bright and warm it made me believe the heat would linger, that there would always be more days, that blood on handkerchiefs was an exercise in stain removal and not a sign of oblivion"".

,"Childrens, Middle Grade, Fiction, Realistic Fiction, Young Adult, Contemporary",Lara (Bookish_turtle),"Woah! Just... woah! What an incredie book! I really want everybody to read this mesmerising story!
I picked it up when I saw it was nominated for the Goodreads Choice Awards this year, and I am so glad that I did.
This book is told in a series of recordings 11-year-old Alex has made on his iPod, which he plans to send into outer space on a rocket he's building. He's making the recordings so that the aliens can get an idea of what it's like being a human on Earth.
Normally I immensely dislike unusual formats, and I was skeptical when I saw it was a series of recording transcripts, but this was absolutely perfect!
Alex is such a brilliant protagonist! He has a huge personality, a dog called Carl Sagan, and a love of all things to do with rockets and outer space. And even though he's only eleven, he's at least thirteen in responsibility years!
Seeing the events through his eyes was fantastic! He is innocent in that he doesn't understand some of what's going on around him, but not in the sense that he's clueless. A lot of the time it's because people won't tell him anything rather than the fact that he can't understand. It was enlightening, fresh and fantastic to read from the perspective of a younger child.
His story is also great. He has his share of struggles, but he always pulls through. The story was so heartfelt, and Alex is always so brave, even when everything around him is crumbling.
The entire cast of characters was also perfect! Zed was awesome. I don't even know what to say about him. He was just awesome. And Terra was also brilliant, I loved seeing her character unfold as the story progressed.
Be warned though, it is quite sad in many places. But it was a brilliant journey and I absolutely loved this book! It was funny, cute, sad, real, and just all-round incredible! Definitely recommend! I wish everybody would read this!

Iâ€™ve been following most of her series and as Sloane Kennedy more and more links all her characters, it feels nice to follow up on all these sexy guys and couples.
Even though MMM is not my usual trope, I went with this one, just because I was curious about Everett, a former US president mourning his dead lover and estranged to Reese, his son, about Nash, the bodyguard who reacted quite strongly to Everett, and of course Gage.
I was not disappointed : I liked these characters as much as the others and the chemistry and the steam were delicious. Added bonus : less action this time as the story takes place mostly at Gageâ€™s place with a lot of guests, including Everett and Nash as well as Reese, recovering from intensive injuries.
Why only 3 stars ? Well, itâ€™s in comparison of all the other instalments of the series. I liked this one, but not as much as some others. The past from all this men felt too manufactured for me and I didnâ€™t really grasp the connection between Everett, Nash and Gage, despite the chemistry and the hotness.

Mia has vented a bit to Jake, that her sister Lucy is making a bad decision in getting married so quickly just because she is pregnant.
When they meet up again at the Vegas wedding chapel, Lucy has started spotting and fears she is going to lose the baby. Mia thinks this might not be such a bad thing, since it was what initiated such a quick marriage to begin with, but puts aside her own personal feelings and takes over with her nurse training and manages to get Lucy to a hospital where she learns that baby is safe for the moment, but Lucy will be on strict rest until the doctor feels the baby is well enough that she can go back to normal life again. This doesn't sit well for Lucy who wants her marriage and honeymoon to Sam to be picture perfect, but Sam is more than willing to wait.
Mia is planning on leaving soon to head off on a Missions trip where she will take her medical training and help children in third world countries, but insists that she will stay and help Lucy until that happens. Jake insists on Sam and Lucy moving to the Tanner ranch where there is plenty of help and support to help not only Lucy, but Jake's mother Claire who is in the early stages of Alzheimer's. This also gives Jake and Mia time to explore their own feelings for one another even though they agree remaining friends is the best thing knowing where they both envision a future for themselves. But does God have other plans? Find out by picking up this wonderful heart-warming romance!

Iâ€™m lost for words, unlike A.H. His seem to flow effortlessly across the page. So, my stab at a review will probably be a series of random thoughts.
The novel spans 70+ years â€“ c. 1939 â€“ c. 2012, set in England; itâ€™s the most English novel Iâ€™ve read in a long time. Perhaps it should be required reading on the syllabus of would-be British citizens. Some no doubt would change their minds half way through the book, questioning their sanity in wanting to be â€œone of usâ€ in the first place.
It opens in war time Oxford, students enlisting for King and Country. The ones we meet are gay (in the â€˜friends of Dorothyâ€™ sense) closeted or otherwise: they couldnâ€™t emerge into the open until the late 1960s when the law was changed. But the closet is a very British institution and it will lurk on regardless into 2012 and beyond. It will help define personal relationships, especially father/son ones and contribute to the rise and fall of the mighty, particularly in public life.
The book is set in the heart of the art world at this time, generally in London, home of the Establishment too. Johnny Sparsholt is an artist, gay and the son of David Sparsholt, a successful businessman, a very pillar of the establishment, but then thereâ€™s this Sparsholt Affair...
If you want to know more you know what to doâ€¦ I urge you to. Itâ€™s beautifully written, echoes for me at times of E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, L.P. Hartley but Hollinghurst has his own strong and lovely voice.

,"Romance, Contemporary, Contemporary Romance",Myla,"Iâ€™m speechless after finishing this book, itâ€™s absolutely brilliant! Iâ€™m one of those readers who clamor for more Bristol and Grip. Overjoyed when Kennedy decided to write Still and it became one of my anticipated releases this year and she didnâ€™t disappoint. Kennedy didnâ€™t write just for the sake of writing a sequel but she wrote this book with finesse; her words are heartwarming that will touch you to the core. Itâ€™s beautifully written through and through.
In Still, Bristol and Grip continue with their life together, some people still doubt their love for each other. What I like about this couple is their open communication to each other they may have some arguments just like any other couple but at the end of the day, they were able to resolve it.
Thereâ€™s a particular scene that totally wrecked me that, I need to stop reading for awhile because my vision went blurred with tears. Itâ€™s one of the most heart-wrenching decisions Bristol and Grip have to make. Will they make the right choice? How will this decision affect their relationship?
Still is an endearing love story of two people, who knows what an unconditional love is. That no matter what life throws at them they'll face it together.
This is one of the best series I've read this year. Kennedy Ryan just blows me away with this book. A real page-turner and those sexy times, sizzling! Grip can be such a dirty talker. *fans self* I greatly recommend this series, because the time I spent reading this series, was time well-spent!

This cover screams cute right?? I mean the cute couple under an umbrella, the various tones of pink, the city as their background all indicate a cute story on the inside. And it was!!
Sophia has just seven days left in Tokyo until her and her mom and sister move to New Jersey for her mom's job. That is only seven days to say goodbye to her best friend, her crush and the city that she loves. Nothing will ruin these perfect days until Jamie Foster-Collins moves back and messes up all of her plans. As everything unravels around Sophia, Jamie seems to be the only one there to help. But with her leaving so soon can it lead to anything but goodbye?
I am just going to get this out of the way and say my favorite thing about this book was Tokyo. I have never read a book set there and this one did such an amazing job of giving me a real visual and feel to life there. I loved all the talk about their stores, the food, how they got around. I also loved the idea of their school and lots of different people being there and the division between those who had money and those who really didn't.
Sophia and her friends were fun. They went out a lot for high school but maybe i was just lame or maybe it is the Tokyo way. Still, that made their outings fun. There was conflict between them all at various points for various reasons and I could buy it all. I thought it all resolved organically too. Sophia and Jamie were cute. They definitely suited each other. I was rooting for them but with a seven day count down I wasn't sure how they would end up.
There was also interesting family dynamics between Sohpia and her mom, her sister and her dad. They didn't go super deep with any of it but I like what it added to the story.
Overall, this was really a cute story with an adorable romance and some interesting friend and family dynamics. The real star here for me was Tokyo though. If you want a quick read to takes you out of the normal setting (US or Europe is mainly what I see in these books) I would recommend this one easily.This review was originally posted on Rebel Mommy Book Blog (less)",Positif
,"Mystery, Historical, Thriller, Fiction",Kimberly Ann,"From the inside flap: ""As the Great Blizzard of 1888 cripples the vast machinery that is New York City, heiress Prudence MacKinzie sits anxiously within her palatial Fifth Avenue home waiting for her fiancÃ©e's safe return. But the fearsome storm rages through the night. With daylight more, than two hundred people are found to have perished in the icy winds and treacherous snowdrifts. Among them is Prudence's fiancÃ©e - his body frozen, his head crushed by a heavy branch, his fingers clutching a single playing card, the Ace of Spades...
Close on the heels of her father's untimely demise, Prudence is convinced that Charles' death was no accident. The Ace of Spades was a code he shared with his school friend, Geoffrey Hunter, a former Pinkerton agent and attorney from the South. Wary of sinister forces closing in on her, Prudence turns to Geoffrey as her only hope in solving a murder not all believe in -- and to help protect her inheritance from a stepmother who seems more interested in he family fortune than Prudence's well being.""
Well, I'd say that the above blurb was rather over dramatic & Gothically eerie, and so too is the book. So why did I check the book out? I wasn't paying close attention to what I was reading, when I picked it up off the shelf, and one of my favorite Historical Mystery authors, Victoria Thompson, gave it a good review.
So the book begins w/ Charles (who is carrying in his briefcase the legal marriage papers that will set Prudence free from her stepmother) following an older attorney out into the BLIZZARD attempting to make sure that the older man remains safe... Which I immediately questioned the sanity of.
The author goes on to describe the ferocity of the blizzard and the fact that one could not see in front of them. Unbelievable for me was if one was unable to see, how would the murderer know that Charles was out & about and how could he follow Charles, cosh him in the head, and steal the briefcase?
Then we read that Prudence's father married a much younger woman, who when the father was not present was beastly cruel to the young Prudence... and now Prudence has a dependency on Laudanum which she is weaning herself off of, by pouring her nightly warm milk (which her stepmother lovingly prepares) out the bedroom window.
Prudence is just 19 and unable to be free of her Stepmother unless she is to marry, which she is about to do... Charles was on his way with all the legal marriage papers that would bring Prudence into full inheritance.
I didn't like the writing, I didn't like the characters (which you all know is a deal breaker for me), but the plot was a good one, even if overtly Gothic. I also found the book to be rather violent, right up to the end, which was another -â˜….

After Roxie and Natalie, it's now Clara's time to tell us her story!
She's been hired by a soon-to-be-retired Hotel owner to bring his family's luxury resort into the 21st century. They desperately need more guests and lots of updates in all areas of the hotel.
But soon-to-be-hotel-boss Archie is not really agreeing with his dad. He doesn't need some city girl to come and change everything he loves about this place.
Archie and Clara have this insta-hate / insta-mega-attraction thing going.
But both also have gone through a lot in their pasts that makes them shy away from something serious.
So it'll probably be a fun few months for Clara - to get her job done while lusting after Archie - who hates what she's doing with his hotel!
And it'll be even funnnnner for the reader to witness all that adorableness! â˜º

Finally back in the beautiful Hudson Valley!
And this was such a great story!!!!
An enemies to lovers kind of thing. With so many adorable moments and fun moments and sexy moments and crazy, ridiculous moments and moving moments. I loved every second of this book.
You start reading and you immediately think you've traveled 30 years back in time to that Hotel from Dirty Dancing
The whole atmosphere of the book was so ... real somehow. I felt like I was right there, checked-in, in that amazingly beautiful hotel. Beautiful - but also very ... old. Clara's help is desperately needed. And Archie will see that soon enough! Poor guy. He's not into modern things. He wants to keep everything the way his grandfather wanted it, he's big on traditions. He's a bit 'Olden-Times-ish' himself. A Cary Grant kind of gentleman. I think I could totally see Hugh Grant as Archie in the Buns-Movie!!! No idea why! He's way too old to be Archie, but the British stuffiness would be perfect!
But of course Archie is not always so .... Archie-ish.
We have some very sexy sexy scenes!!! â˜º
Beautiful book with so much in it. So much interesting hotel stuff. How to make more money with an old hotel. I loved that. And all those old traditions at the hotel. I loved the whole mood and atmosphere. I want to check in there immediately!!!
And we also have an amazing cast - all our Hudson Valley darlings show up for special events at the hotel - and we might even see an old friend from San Francisco again â˜º Because that hotel needs lots of walls un-banged! â˜º And another 2 beloved west-coasters might check into the hotel (one of them might be a red-head) â˜º
PERFECT BOOK!!
BUNS was such an adorably funny & interesting & sexy romance!
You'll sooo fall in love with Clara & her Cary Grant-ish Hotel-Boy! Also, I will be permanently leaving Germany soon! Upstate NY, here I come!!! I'm accepting donations for my Bryant-Hotel-Penthouse via paypal! And Archie, I want a TV in my penthouse! â˜º

This is my least favourite of the Harry Potter series, and almost borders on the ""don't bother"". It is saved only by the virtue that it is a Harry Potter book and moves the series along to the still yet unknown finale.
My issues with it:

Things I loved about Holding Back the Stars by Katie Khan
- When I read about the world the story took place in, I was so excited because it sounded so cool! The story takes place in the future, there has been a disastrous nuclear war and a new country has been formed, namely Europia. (It took me way too long to figure out that this was a contraction of Europe and Utopia.) This war resulted in an asteroid belt around the Earth, so everybody was earthbound. The technology they use is really cool and futuristic, but beside that, the thing that makes this world so awesome that itâ€™s focused on the individual. They instated Rotation, which means that every three year you move (alone) to some other place on the Earth. No three years are the same, you meet new people, you get to see the world, learn new languages, but you are still able to visit your friends because the transport is super fast!
â€œItâ€™s a better society, if everyone can give their all. So we all contribute towards the utopia as an individual, until such a time we can begin to think about settling down and starting a family.â€
- I loved that Carys was really smart. I always love smart characters, but usually the scientists are male. And seeing a bad-ass female scientist/astronaut/pilot always makes me happy.
- This is no simple love story where two people fall in love and live happily ever after. Itâ€™s complex, itâ€™s wonderful but itâ€™s also awful at some times. In this society there is the Couples Rule, which basically means that you canâ€™t have a family before youâ€™re like 35 or something. The first part of your life should be focused on you, and you alone. But what if you fall in love against all your better knowing?
- This book is funny. There were so many times I found myself laughing out loud. Especially Max is really funny, but Carys can be funny too!
â€œâ€˜Carys?â€™ he asks, as they continue to watch the fireworks display over the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China.
â€˜Yes, Max?â€™
â€˜Nothing.â€™
â€˜Are you sure?â€™
â€˜Yes, Carys.â€™
â€˜Iâ€™m glad we had this conversation, Max,â€™ she says, deadpan.
â€˜Me, too,â€™ he replies.â€
- Itâ€™ll make you happy, itâ€™ll make you sad, itâ€™ll make you wonder, itâ€™ll make you think. This book is filled with beautiful quotes:
â€œThere will always be broken people, no matter how well society worksâ€
There was one thing that I didnâ€™t like, and I canâ€™t really say what it is, because then I would spoil the book for you. But I can say that it left me feeling very confused and only after a few chapters I understood what was actually going on.
I am giving this book â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… (4/5 stars) because it is wonderful. It is everything I didnâ€™t know I was looking for in a book. I gave it one star less because of that vague thing I am not going to tell you about. It makes me wonder if I should read more sci-fi, because I barely do and I have read two real sci-fi books now and I loved them both. They were both funny and smart and so good! I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something that is both romantic, thoughtful, interesting, and likes sci-fi. IT TAKES PLACE IN SPACE, like, go read that book!!

This book needs to come with a trigger warning. On page brutal rape (which is not mentioned in the blurb), minor on page character death, OTT abuse by a parent, cheesy inspirational prose, magic peen and chicks with dicks.
The rape and death happen in the past and then the story jumps forward and we have to wait almost until the end of the book to find out what happened to the guys who assaulted and raped Arrow. I gotta admit that's one of the only reasons I kept going. I needed justice. But after waiting all that time....all that happens is that Lorhaven beats the men almost to death and barely misses going to jail? That's it?!? Are they held accountable? Arrested or charged? We don't know cuz it's not mentioned just that Lor almost killed them. Mmmkay. We don't even get to be a part of it so we can have our own bloodthirsty revenge, grrrrr. Plus the guy who rapes him is a homophobic asshole but he gets hard and rapes Arrow in front of his friends while they hold him down? Plausible sure but just didn't jive with me. Also 2 guys contributed to Matt's death. What happened to them? Why was Hopper the only one held responsible? We never learn what happens and if their held accountable for their actions that day as well. The author made me experience two traumatic events with these guys and I got nothing....no justice, no revenge and no closure. In the end I was left unsettled and pissed the fuck off. Put a fucking trigger warning in your blurb, if I had known I would've had to experience that I never would've read it. The least the author could've done was give me closure not some casually flippant remark near the end of the book like ""Oh yeah the guys who raped me were beat up by my brother. He beat them almost to death so it's ok."" It was almost like she didn't care enough to tie up lose ends....too much effort.
Arrow and Hopper are corny. We're told rather than shown their chemistry. They meet and they have all these FEELINGS for each other and it's like they know each deep down because they are both broken and they just get each other BEFORE even having a conversation? They fall in love in a blink. Arrow who has stayed out of relationships because of his past assault and Hopper who lost the love of his life and swears to always be loyal...just meet and BAM fuck all that? Nah...I didn't buy it. I wanted to see them meet and form a connection not be told they had one. Arrow has been hesitant to have sex but within a week it's mutual blow jobs and fucking Hopper? And they have unprotected sex with no discussion or talk of any previous test results. All hail the magic of the peen. I just didn't find any of this shit believable.
Arrow was such an amazing character in the first 2 books and I was really looking forward to his story. This was a HUGE let down. She didn't do justice to the character or give him the story he deserved.
And dammit.....its not a fucking G-spot on a guy. It's a prostate or if you absolutely have to be corny....a P-spot ( lame). The G-spot is located inside a VAGINA. Ugh. (less)",Negatif

,"Mystery, Fiction, Humor, Audiobook",Sophia,"For years, I've been meaning to try a Janet Evanovich book. I thought it would be her acclaimed Stephanie Plum series, but then this one which was only two books in, caught my eye and, yes, I confess, it was because I adore Lorelei King as a narrator.
I was a little concerned that I was picking up the second book in a series, but shrugged it off. Dangerous Minds ended up doing just fine out of order and would work as a standalone.
The book opens with a startling arrival to wealthy Emerson Knight's estate. His former mentor, a soft-voiced Buddhist monk states that his island home disappeared. Of course, it was funny, but also set the ball in motion for eccentric Emerson, redoubtable Riley, along with Emerson's hilarious horn-dog cousin Vernon, and the monk, Wayan, to head out on their latest adventure.
Throughout the book, I found myself bursting out with laughs, mostly at Vernon's juvenile humor, but nearly as often at Emerson. Evanovich knows how to write brilliant, quirky and engaging characters.
The setting for this latest case is America's Nat'l Parks that contain volcanic action. I loved this, particularly, since I just spent a bit this past summer camping at a Nat'l Park and exploring its volcanic region and I've been to Yellowstone, twice, where lots of the story took place.
This is a lighter suspense story with the bad guys evident from the beginning, but the mystery of what they are hiding in the national parks being the unknown element. There are a few 'ew' moments when things get gritty, but for the most part, the intrepid gang of heroes manage to keep life and limb intact while cheesing it up.
There is a very slow-build romance element between Emerson and Riley, but the situation they are in causes this to stop and start its way along. They are a fun pair of opposites.
Lorelei King told a saucy adventure well and I loved that though there are many more male voices than female, she nailed it. Great match for the tone and pace of the book.
So, my first outing with a Janet Evanovich book was a rousing good success and I will definitely want more Knight & Moon adventures. I think the cozy mystery and light romantic suspense lovers would be a good fit for this book/series.

It would be nice if Bernie Manuelito could learn to improve her diet, before she develops Diabetes like Palmer and so many other indians.

This is the fourth book I have read by Devney Perry and I love her writing style. All of her characters just feel very real. Sabrina has a tough battle to find herself and to find the strength she will need to get through a very difficult and scary time in her life. Add to this the spectacular Montana backdrop and you have the perfect combination for a winning romance novel.
And hello Beau!! Like all of the author's heroes, Beau is sweet, HOT, loyal and did I mention hot? And he has a heart of gold. He takes care of Sabrina and offers her shelter and protection. What she initially thought would be an impossible situation turns into a safe and protective haven for her, all thanks to Beau. He's honest, trustworthy and gorgeous.
""Beau was the type of man who needed someone with much less baggage than I was carting around. Nothing could happen between us. A fling would certainly lead to disaster.""
Like all of Ms. Pevney's main characters, Sabrina and Beau have to fight for their chance at happiness. And when it comes, it is simply beautiful! The author writes some of the VERY best Epilogues around. And I am a total pushover for a great Epilogue.
I loved the mountain setting and the brave and selfless firefighters in this book. As always, this book seems very well-researched and it shows in the writing. Don't be afraid to jump in at this point in the series and read 'The Outpost.'

In writing a novel, writers may research different places, people, professions. While working on his best-seller, Thomas Huston had conferred with state trooper Ryan DeMarco about legal aspects, criminal behavior and related topics. They became friendly over the course of many of these meetings,. Ryan DeMarco canâ€™t quite make himself believe that Huston has killed his family, this family DeMarco believed he so cherished. He had everything, why would he do that? And where is Thomas?
Hustonâ€™s been working on a new novel, which may or may not hold some clues to his state of mind, give DeMarco something to probe, but are there answers there? Hustonâ€™s also a college professor with students and co-workers. Student affair? Professional jealousy? And where is the novel he was working on?
Thomas Huston is a man with his own demons, though, his mother brutally murdered during a holdup in their little store, his father, unable to live without her, with the memories, takes his own life soon thereafter. As happy or content as he may be now, these memories never really leave.
â€œHe understood how a single event could shred a privileged life, leave it tattered and flapping in the black gales of night.â€
Ryan DeMarco also has his own demons, his son and wife gone â€“ a tragic car accident which both Ryan and his wife survived, only to lose the one thing that tethered them to each other. This haunts him still.
A student of Hustonâ€™s, Nathan, is helpful in giving insights into what Hustonâ€™s new novel-in-progress was about, a Lolita-like character merged with Poeâ€™s Annabelle Lee who is young and hopeful, an exotic dancer? Perhaps. In the name of research Huston went in search of the one to build his Annabelle from. And, also in the name of research, DeMarco follows in an attempt to find a girl who Huston might have viewed as his muse.
There were parts of â€œTwo Days Goneâ€ which I loved, but there was so much of this that I â€œknewâ€ from fairly early on in the story to take some of the thrill out, but by this point in the story there were enough other avenues involved that kept my attention. I enjoyed the various forks in the road taken. I was entertained. The writing was atmospheric, the prose often lovely.

Every time I pick up a new Lauren Blakely book, I wonder how long it will take me to fall in love with the main male character. It's pretty much become a laughable game I play considering most of the time, I fall head over heels immediately. And Tyler Nichols? Yup.....it happened in seconds as I pretty much fell ass-over-elbow for this hot and sexy yet sweet, dirty-talking man! He is definitely as swoon-worthy as Blakely's other men but he's certainly a standout in terms of what exactly he will do in order to win Delaney Stewart's heart! For Tyler it's ""Go Big or Go Home"". Delaney, while beautiful, funny, strong and confident, displayed a vulnerability that any woman who has been hurt in the past can easily identify with. As always, Blakely's characters are always incredibly developed and completely relatable because of how ""real"" they are. Tyler and Delaney have so much chemistry but Blakely makes us wait for the ultimate payoff in a slow-burn sort of way. It's electric! These characters have a strong history and it shows in just how well they truly know one another. However, both characters do have secrets that they need to share in order to break down the walls they've built to protect themselves. While we know that these two will have a happy ending (hello, it IS a Lauren Blakely book!), readers will connect to Tyler and Delaney's struggle to let go of the past so they can build a new future together.
I'm a sucker for second-chance romance stories and Blakely hits it out of the park with The Hot One. The sexy times are super sexy and the laughs are plenty in this dual-POV rom-com. It's hilarious, fun, sweet and sexy with just the right amount of emotion to create a beautiful 5-star story about reconnecting with your first love and playing for keeps. (less)",Positif

Words on Bathroom Walls
The kind-of-sane part of this review:
Adam:
Adam, is our main character. God, did I want to hug him until he couldn't breathe anymore. He is schizo. But that's not all that he is. He is also sweet, a great cook*soo jealous*, honest to a fault, moody, a good friend and finally, the best boyfriend any girl could have.
One of his imaginary friends, is Rebecca. I wanted to be her. I wanted to do cart-wheels when he's happy *I would break my neck*, hold his hand and just be there for him.
He's trying a new drug, that seems to be working at first. We read the notes that he is writing to his psychiatrist. Where he talks about his disease, school, family and whatever he's going through.
Which makes the reader not just relate to him but feel whatever he's feeling.*did I say feel too many times? I think so too.*
He's dreamy, swoon-worthy and every other adj that ends with y.
The romance:
Say hello to Maya and Adam, everyone:
The family:
It plays a big part in this book since Adam's mom is dealing with her son's mental illness. I loved how proctective she was of him. And then there is Paul: Adam's step dad. Thank you for being not just amazing but fucking amazing.
Dwight:
You're the man. Thank you for everything that you did. And we both love talking, so it's okay.
Silence is awkward and over-rated.
Reading this book, I cried from sadness, happiness and random passages where I couldn't handle the feels.
Wise words that I say in every five-star-review:

,"Romance, M M Romance, Contemporary",haletostilinski,"OH YES, This book simply made me giddy!
It's been 4 years since the end of Trust, the third book, and Logan and Tate are still going strong. This picks up about 7 or so months since Wedlocked (the series focused on Ace and Dylan) and it starts with Logan just finishing a huge case that has kept him away from Tate more than he would like, and Tate having way too many late nights at the bar that take him away from Logan more than he would like. So they both take action to step back slightly from work so they can have more time for each other.
And what follows is just amazing <333 What I love is that Ella Frank didn't continue this series just to add some manufactured drama and ""spice things up"" no, whatever drama there is came naturally - and it's mostly with Tate's family/Robbie the - now former - barista from the earlier books (the one who shamelessly flirted with Logan and came onto him. Also, I smell a new book or book series because Robbie meets a new lawyer Logan and Cole bring to their firm and sparks were there, so...I already want to read that book lol) who has some family trouble and comes to Logan for help - and I just love that fact that these two were HAPPY together and there wasn't any of that ""oh shit, they've been happily together for 4 years, gotta have life shit on them, kick them in the ass and shake things up - nah, this book avoided that often annoying pitfall (because usually when that trope is used it introduces drama for the sake of drama and not really anything else) and focused on Logan and Tate just being together and I fucking love that.
This was almost pure fluff (like Wedlocked, another favorite of mine), with lots of sexy times (really fucking HOT sexy times. These two were always explosive together and they're still explosive here. I love that we're getting more of them, that I get to read more of these two together because they melt my heart, ahhh <333) but also it it includes steps to getting these two to move forward into the next step of their life together, which I feel wasn't a waste at all, and made this more than just shameless fluff and smut.
While not a ton of plot happened, I didn't mind. It was kinda true to life, ya know, not every moment - or stretch of time, however long that may be - in someone's life is entertaining or filled with excitement or plot, for lack of a better term lol. But Tate's sister reaches out to him, 4 years later, which is something that could totally happen irl, like you're just going about your life, and it's perfectly normal, and then BOOM, someone from your past or an estranged family member comes back into your life and you're like holy shittt what??? So stuff happened, even if it wasn't a lot of stuff, imo.
And also!!! (view spoiler).
I highly recommend anyone weary about continuing to read more in this series to pick this one up (cause I know the third one ended perfectly and the little snippets of them we got in other books from this universe were good too, so why do we need more? BUT!!) because it is so worth it. There's no angst or melodrama or any ruining of these two men's relationship. It's really just setting up, I think, the next two books, by moving Logan and Tate into the next stage of their life together. I can't wait for the next book. I love this series and I love Ella Frank and i JUST NEED MORE <333 (less)",Positif
,"Romance, Fiction, Contemporary, Womens Fiction, Chick Lit",â„ï¸Naniâ„ï¸,"Whatâ€™s a person gotta do to get some hearts broken here?
Iâ€™ve been in search of an emotionally damaging read that tugs at my heartstrings for far too long with no luck whatsoever.
A reputable source tells me this might be it... be it.
This is what I said prior to starting this book... the depressed me who was sat staring at blank space for hours, just wasting the day away could go back and punch the yesterday me with the big mouth. ðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸
I'm dead inside. I feel so fucking empty and melancholic.
I havenâ€™t felt this depressed by a book in such a long time that I must've forgotten the sharp sting of an emotionally stirring read since I kept going on and on about ""needing to read some depressing book."" I knew it was going to be a hard hitting read but never did I imagine it to hit me this hard. ðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸
One of my mottos in life is â€™be careful what you wish for'â€“with good reason because I've had some wishes come true only to completely backfired on on my face- so, Iâ€™ve learned, over time, to weigh all options before I open my mouth. Evidently, all logic and common sense goes out the window the moment books enter the picture.
âœ¨ The plot:
Plot-wise, there's really not much I can say because the blurb literally explains word for word what the bookâ€™s all about.
It's about â€˜that one great loveâ€™ that spans decades since its start on September 11, 2001, a day when Lucy and Gabe met at Columbia University and nothing was the same again.
Over a course of a decade, Lucy recounts her turbulent relationship with Gabe and their whirlwind romance as young love unfolds and life (stupid life) gets in the way. Their romance gets interrupted as both want to make a difference and seek a meaning in life so he leaves to become a photo-journalist in war-torn lands and she stays in NY and becomes a children's TV producer.
âœ¨ The narrative:
The narrative is written in the second person as a kind of one-sided conversation/monologue as lucy is addressing Gabe as â€˜youâ€™, much like the novel, YOU by Caroline Kepness.
The story flows easily across the years with a study pace that captivates the reader as Lucy evaluates her life and scrutinises over some of life's unanswered questions: Are our lives shaped by our own choices or by forces outside our control? Are first loves forever? And is it worth risking stability and comfort for a love that is unpredictable and explosive? This is a devastating novel about decisions made, roads not taken, opportunities created and lost and ultimately about love and loss.
The heartbreak is real, guys. It is real and it is savage. (less)",Positif

Me and Riley Hart don't have an easy relationship; I end up loving her books or hating them, no middle ground. Fortunately, this fell in the 'love them' category.
Fake betrothals/relationships/marriages (and amnesia) are my catnip; there is no way I will overlook a book with such a plot. So though most of my GR friends seemed to dislike this book, I had to try it out. And I'm really, really happy I did.
Gary and Travis start a fake relationship in order to prove to Gary's ex that he's over him. Meanwhile, an investor, who plans on giving money to Travis to open his own business, sees them together and seems to approve of the relationship so they decide to continue with the charade. And since the chemistry between them is explosive, why not have a 'friends with benefits' type of relationship? Of course, any reader worth his salt can see how this will end, but as I said, I love these troppes, so I didn't mind the predictability of the plot one bit. Also, both heroes have family issuesthat add some depth to the plot, while the secondary characters (mainly Derek and Hayden) were interesting additions that will probably have their own stories told later on.
It's a rather light book by all means, a bit overfilled with sex scenes (I'd prefer a bit more everyday living scenes between them), a twist in the end that I didn't feel added anything to the story, some angst when those two tried to come to terms with their feelings, a bit of family drama, but overall it was fun and very very enjoyable. I especially loved how Hart managed to portray Travis as a confident and carefree guy, only to slowly add more layers in his personality that made a lot of sense and made him so much more than just a sexy body. Gary was likable to me from the start but it was nice to see him find his footing and gain some much needed confidence as well.
I'm looking forward to other books in the series, Hayden's in particular. (less)",Positif

,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Romance",Candace,"What a surprisingly captivating world Stephanie Garber has created in 'Caraval'! I listened to the Audible version of this book and I was mesmerized by the beautiful and vivid imagery that 'Caraval' contained. I was drawn in by the world that Ms. Garber created and it held my attention right to the very end.
Every once in a while, I love a great paranormal romance. I love to leave reality behind and take off on a journey to a place where magic and fairytales exist. This was the perfect story to do just that.
Scarlett, aka ""Crimson"", and her sister Tella have lived under the oppressive rule of their father. His cruelty seems to know no bounds and he takes satisfaction in tormenting his daughters. Knowing how close the girls are to one another, he uses their love against them. When one of his daughters breaks a rule, it is the other one that will receive the punishment.
Awaiting her arranged marriage to a Count that she's never met before, Scarlett is just biding her time until she can get away from her sadistic father. She's literally counting down the weeks until she will be married and can take her sister with her to her new home. Unlike Scarlett, Tella is skeptical of the mysterious fiancÃ© that seems to say all of the right things but whose identity remains shrouded in mystery.
Before Scarlett can be married off, she receives an invitation from Legend, the famous mastermind behind the Caraval. Despite writing to Legend ever since she was a young child, Scarlett has never received a response before. Now, with the clock counting down to her wedding, it seems like fate that she would receive her first ever response and an invitation to participate in the Caraval.
With the support of her sister, Scarlett sets off for the mysterious island where Legend has indicated that the Caraval is taking place. Along with Tella, she sets sail with Julian, a young sailor, to participate in the forbidden game. Both sisters know that they are risking their lives by sneaking off against their father's wishes. However, they are willing to take their chances in order to seize a once in a lifetime opportunity.
From that point forward, the girls are caught up in a magical and dangerous world. Appearances are not what they seem and even time moves differently in this new world. Caraval is a game where the stakes are very high and not everyone will come out alive or unscathed.
I don't want to give anything away or ruin the surprise for others. There were many twists and turns that I didn't see coming while listening to this story. Just when I thought I had everything figured out, something else would happen that made me question everything again. This story held my attention and kept me guessing right to the very end.
If you like adventure/fantasy/paranormal stories with plenty of twists and turns, this is a great choice. There is some romance, but it took a back seat to the magical world of Caraval. For me, the adventure and mystery of Caraval reigned supreme. Of course, there is a love story weaved into this fantastical story as well. Just, don't plan on a super-smutty type of story where the focus on the romance is paramount.
All in all, I thought that this was a wonderful story. I was enchanted by the world that Ms. Garber created and cannot wait to read the next installment. This book filled my head with some beautiful and vibrant imagery that will hang with me for quite some time. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a paranormal/fantasy/adventure to read. It was fantastic! (less)",Positif
,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Paranormal",C.G. Drews,"THIS BOOK LIVES TO TORTURE US. THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY. No wait. I also want to say: it was absolutely gorgeously darkly bloodily brilliant and I'm so so pleased. Also devastated. ALSO PLEASED. Part of me knew how it'd end, though, and I was right and I'm currently c r y i n g ... but it was good. It was a good and perfect book.
I don't want calm feelings anyway.
I also don't want this to be over because August and Kate are two very very very precious characters to me. And everything about this series somehow caught my heart. I'm kind of crumbling into a gasping hole of appreciation for it. I LOVE IT. I DO.
It's too hard to review so I'll just give you a nice list:
SMOL THINGS I LOVED:
â€¢ it is so so so entirely bloody and dark
â€¢ SUPER DARK BOOK IS SUPER DARK
â€¢ it reminds me of Batman Begins, if Gotham was Verity
â€¢ August is the sweetest most tortured monster of ever and my heart bleeds for him
â€¢ Kate is so powerful and sharp and wondrous and i am so pleased with how she developed in this book (view spoiler)
â€¢ the monsters are wickedly dark
â€¢ and complex
â€¢ everything about the writing was gorgeous and visual and sensory and every word was perfectly chosen
â€¢ I loved the addition of bits of verse in this one!! It just made the story so much richer and bursting with feeling
â€¢ AUGUST <3 <3 <3
â€¢ there are battles and scars and death and darkness and honestly this duology is just magnificent and I love how it asks questions about sinners and right vs wrong and what truly makes a monster

,"Romance, Contemporary, New Adult, Contemporary Romance",Sejla,"Katy Regnery did it again!!! She blew my mind with another epic book that is going straight on my top favorite list. Being a huge fan of her modern fairytales I was very excited to see what she would make of this story and how some aspects from the little mermaid will be woven into the plot. I won't lie - I had very high expectations of this book! Did Katy manage to meet them? Yes, she absolutely did!
Don't Speak was a beautiful and touching story about love, family and second chances that made me reflect on many things. Sometimes I had to stop reading and close my eyes and let the tears flow because I was so overwhelmed with emotions. Katy's poignant and picturesque writing took me to places I've never been before but could clearly see in front of my eyes. I was fascinated by the fisherman folk and their live style and how she eloquently portrayed their traditions and moral standards.
Laire came from a very different world than Erik. She grew up sheltered and protected as a fisherman's daughter from an Outer Banks island that felt stuck in a world where a woman's reputation can easily be ruined by a wrong move. She wanted more from life than marry a guy and become a mother at a very young age, never getting a chance to see the world and persue a career.
Erik was the son of North Carolinaâ€™s governor and came from a rich family that cared more about keeping appearances than anything else. Growing up in such a shallow world, it's not a surprise that Erik was utterly fascinated with Laire. She was like a fresh breeze in a life that was already planned out for him since the day he was born. Her shyness and naivetÃ© enchanted him and made him feel protective of her.
The way they truly, madly, deeply fell in love was nothing short of magical. Their kisses made me shiver and hold my breath because their feelings for each other were palpable on every page.
It's not a surprise that Katy broke my heart after the first part of the book. I felt Laire's and Erik's agony of losing each other like it was my own! Six years will pass until the former two lovers will see each other again. I strongly recommend you to prepare some tissues because these scenes will shatter you - I can tell!
While it looks like Laire has moved on with her life, Erik seems stuck in the past. The once compassionate and sensible young man has turned into an icy and distant adult, keeping his broken heart unavailable for any woman. But no matter how much both tried, they never got over each other.
""Don't you see? I loved you as a man, in every season, forever. And when I lost you, I lost...everythin'. There was a hole inside me the size of a crater...and nothin', nothin' on God's earth, could have filled it but you.""
Is the universe giving the dark haired prince and his frackled mermaid a second chance? Will the reasons that brought them apart be revealed and finally resolved? In order to find out, you need to read this amazing book!
If you are looking for a brilliantly written story which is the perfect combination of sweet and angsty - then Don't Speak is the right book for you! 5+ stars for the unquestioned queen of modern fairytales: Katy Regnery. (less)",Positif
,"Young Adult, Contemporary, Romance, Fiction ",katwiththehat,"This was a short and sweet romance between Kit and David. Similarly to Julie Buxbaum's ""Tell Me Three Things,"" Kit is dealing with the recent loss of a parent, and how that is affecting her changed perspective on life. I enjoyed Kit's character, but particularly David's, who deals with being neuroatypical by keeping a journal of ""rules"" of how to survive high school and notes on his classmates--who can be trusted and who can't, when a comment should be interpreted as safe and when it's someone trying to mock him and he should steer clear. It's so poignant in the way Buxbaum illustrates the difficulty he has navigating those social rules of human interaction that come easily to everyone else, at least on some level, and that was really the strongest point in the book.
And of course, their romance was just adorable. The soft insecurities. The genuine connection. I also loved the way the book examined familial and friend relationships, and how those are affected by tragedy, and also how people can change and become better versions of themselves. Just a good message overall. 4.5/5 stars.

Sylvain Reynard latest novel is a foray into romantic suspense titled, The Man in the Black Suit and it is an adventure you do not want to miss.
Nicolas Cassirer has a routine of checking to the Hotel Victoire every three months under an assumed name and with eye candy on his arm. Coincidence or perhaps fate, has him checking in alone and he is left to deal with a new concierge. Acacia Santos matches Nicolas in wit and earns his respect quickly, until she makes a rash judgment. Demoted and in risk of losing her job, Nicolas offers Acacia the job of his personal assistant. It is the opportunity of a lifetime and hard to resist, much like the man himself.
Between my short synopsis and that of the blurb you really donâ€™t need much more to know what this is about. The story line is laid out plainly, but it is the intensity of the characters that make this book. As you expect Nicolas has a mysterious persona and has secrets that Acacia is left to discover, but the same goes for her. She has a past that has made her the strong and passionate woman that grabs Nicolasâ€™s attention.
The characters, the story and the culture in this book are interwoven and wonderfully written in intriguing detail. Paris and other mentioned cities are places that I would love to visit in person one day, but Sylvainâ€™s writing made it seems as if I was there already. After reading I felt that I, along with Acacia, had traveled with Nicolas and experienced these romantic and charming landscapes.
This book is different than the Gabriel series that initially made me a fan, but it contains the same detail and emotion. This romantic suspense will captivate you and have you fully in Nicolas and Acaciaâ€™s corner. I highly recommend taking a chance of this novel. Five stars. (less)",Positif

It was captivating from the very first page. The quality of writing was superb and the plot intriguing and thrilling. It had the perfect mix of intense chemistry, sexy alpha, a little kid, and letâ€™s not forget a good amount of suspense and intrigue. I still canâ€™t believe that this was a debut novel â€“ BRAVO Devney Perry â€“ this book wonâ€™t be the last one Iâ€™ll be reading from you.
I think I should mention that even so I LOVE reading about macho alphaâ€™s that are domineering, overwhelmingly sexy and commanding/controlling â€“ I might not be ok with it in REAL LIFE!! That said, I have NOTHING against reading about it, I even go looking for books like that. So, not everything I love reading about I necessarily would want in my life. ITâ€™S FICTION!!! GOTCHA?
Back to The Coppersmith Farmhouse!
New in town, Gigi couldnâ€™t help herself and got right away in an argument with the sexy town sheriff, Jesse. Both rub each other the wrong way until she found out that he was the guy that took care of the Coppersmith farmhouse that was bequeathed to her. Suddenly their bickering took a new meaning.
Not long after Jesse finally understood what the former owner of the Coppersmith farmhouse saw in Gigi and her young daughter. Gigi was down to earth, strong and resilient, and had a kind heart. She was dealt a bad hand which she turned into the best thing that could have happened to her. Being able to relocate with her daughter to the farmhouse gave her a new beginning that she couldnâ€™t turn down.
The little town of Prescott was filled with wonderful characters, including quite a few hunky alpha males, more about that later on.
Her attraction to Jesse might have been inconvenient for her but not so much for Jesse, as soon as he realized what he had in front of him, he wised up and used it to his advantage. In other words he steamrolled poor Gigi with his masculine charms and sex appeal.
He made some mistakes which he fortunately learned from, but like all males, it took him awhile to see the wisdom in it.
Jesse and Gigi were a perfectly suited couple. Their attraction was tangible, genuine and smoldering. His feelings towards Gigiâ€™s daughter was real, and sincere. He was a very straight forward kind of person. Frank and direct, and he wanted to take care of them almost immediately.
That was pretty much the recurring thread throughout the entire book. Both, Gigi and Jesse, had personalities that needed to took care of their loved ones. They were very open about their affections and truly generous with their feelings.
For Jesse it was all about HIS GIRLS. He decided early on that they would be part of his life. With Jesse, Gigi didnâ€™t have to worry about what he thought, he was pretty open and direct about it â€“ almost blunt at times.
The suspense was well thought through and brilliantly executed. I did not see certain aspects coming and the author kept me guessing until the very last minute.
I truly ENJOYED this book. And I canâ€™t WAIT to read more by this author. She has already introduced quite a few very interesting characters that Iâ€™m already REALLY intrigued about. HUNKY alpha males â€“ enough said.:D (oh and one bitchy sister â€“ made me CURIOUS!!!)

I don't want to sound like I'm betraying Jess, Nick nor Silas (oh Jess...), but I can't shake this feeling off me: Beau Holt is my favorite. And not just my favorite in the Jamison Valley. I'm saying top favorite! As in ""one of my favorites...EVER!!!""
This book had all the feelings! It was amazingly well written, it was poignant, intense, the characters and their personalities were exquisite, they were solid, believable, real despite all the fiction!
It's so interesting, because since her Devney's first book I have this feeling that she is not a new author, she has to be doing that for years and years and years. No one can be THAT good in so little time.
But she can!
Every time I read her, with every book, every character, every flaw they have, every mistake they make, every right decision, every regret, I love more and more her books, her imagination, her stories.
Right now, I feel myself a part of the Jamison Valley, and I'm already sad that The Bitteroot Inn (her next book) is going to be the last one in this series.
Ti be even more honest, When I finished this book last dawn (that's right, I went trhough the night reading), I was sad. I was sad because I wasn't ready to say goodbye to Beau and Sabrina. I was sad because I wanted more of their lives, their love, their story. I was truly sad because I already missed them. I wasn't just nostalgic, I was really sad, because I was greedy and needy and this couple just stole my heart completely.
Sabrina was that heroine who you must love! there's no other way! She is a bada**, she is strong, she is selfless, even when she is judging herself and questioning her decisions. She is emotional but in a total understandable way. She is someone you want to be! And even being so amazing, she grew even more during her journey at the outpost and with Beau (and Boone, of course).
""My heart would fall for this sweet and thoughtful man. It was inevitable. And it would be the forever kind of fall""
Beau was a rock. He was solid, reliable, he was someone you could always count on. He was the solver, the amount of peace and safe everyone needs. He was sweet, responsible, caring, nurturing. He is someone you wish fervently and with all your heart that he could be real.
And he knew how to love!
""I didn't want her for right now. I wanted her for always""
Together, they were explosive, but they were also protective. Protective of themselves, but also protective of each other. They were zealous and took amazing care of one another. They were the perfect match you couldn't guess at first.
Anyone would think they were too different, but the truth is that they were different when the balance was needed, but they were made of the same amazingness in all that mattered.
They completed each other. And, what was even more amazing, they weren't just one another's better half. They completed each other because both of them were whole, but together they could become an even better and stronger ""number one"".
""I'd say goodbye to it all, just so I could say hello to her every morning for the rest of my life.""
They were the perfect match. They were the perfect story. They were the perfect love.
The outpost was just the right compass to send them to the right north.
I think I've said this before, but I need to say it again: I'm happy for the day I decided to read The Coppersmith Farmhouse and met Devney Perry. Now I wait for her next books. (less)",Positif

,"Fantasy, Fiction, Epic Fantasy, Dragons, High Fantasy",Emma,"Thank you Robin Hobb.
I can't lie. There have been tears. What a wonderful gift this series has been and what a wonderful final episode.
All strands were connected and interwoven in such an amazing way. Did Robin know how she wanted the story to end up all those years ago when she wrote the Assassin's Apprentice? It boggles my mind.
I also found it slightly strange as well as delightful to see the worlds of the Elderlings and Kelsingra combine with Fitz's. Have you ever seen Bedknobs and Broomsticks? Well it was a bit like that when the real cinematic world combined with the animation!
I noted so many memorable scenes while reading that I thought to cite in this review, but I'm not going to spoil your fun.
I have (almost) never minded the long and winding way in which Robin tells her stories. Every word, you realise afterwards, had its place and its reason. But in this book I found the story zoomed right along from page 1. No more hints and subtle foreshadowing: all that's been done already in the previous books. THIS is the big reveal, where everything comes together.
The ending was fitting and perfect.
Please don't read this unless you've read the preceding volumes of this work. I'm sure Robin wouldn't thank me for saying this with so much of her writing career still to come, but to me this is her Magnum Opus.

,"Fantasy, Fiction, Epic Fantasy",Niki Hawkes - The Obsessive Bookseller,"While trying to compose a review that will do this series justice, the question becomes not whether Oathbringer was an amazing installment in the Stormlight Archive series, but how do I explain how fiercely I loved it without gushing like a fangirl? Suffice to say itâ€™s on a pedestal. I can see so many of the brilliant ideas within it shaping fantasy works for decades to come. It truly is the next evolution in the genre similar to that brought on by the likes of Jordan and Tolkien. At least, thatâ€™s how I feel about it.
Expansive world building always wins me over, and I can think of very few worlds as impressive as Sandersonâ€™s Roshar. Stormlight Archive is a series that encompasses many different cultures across this island continent. Sanderson provides a constant infusion of these races by highlighting their differences (and celebrating their similarities). This variety of humanity is easily my favorite element. Iâ€™ve experienced so many exotic places in this series alone â€“ it truly is a wonder. It is world building like this that makes me ecstatic to be a reader.
I especially loved learning more about each culture through the diverse cast of characters within Bridge Four (even if I am just an â€œairsick lowlanderâ€). Iâ€™ve always loved the characters in this series, but I think Oathbringer is the first book Iâ€™ve also appreciated their complexity/duality. Theyâ€™re definitely not cookie-cutter profiles with mildly interesting back-stories, but deeply flawed individuals with more than just the external conflicts to overcome. If the first two books delved into Kaladin and Shallanâ€™s past, respectively, then book three was an exploration of the events that shaped Dalinar. Even minor characters in this series are rich and interesting, and I eat up all new information revealed about every single one of them. There were a few new characters that got to share the limelight in Oathbringer (brought in from the interludes in previous books) and I delighted in how they changed the dynamics of the story.
If Iâ€™m honest, Iâ€™ll admit that there were a few moments throughout Oathbringer where I wondered if the pacing was a little too slow (keeping in mind that I didnâ€™t have a single issue with pacing for the first two 1000+ page novels). It had me considering if it was enough of an issue to take away from my enjoyment of all the other amazing elements. Ultimately, it wasnâ€™t because every time I thought it, something profound would happen to reel me back in. Then the snowball climax of the story hit and all of my hesitations were swept away. The book felt different than the first two, but that doesnâ€™t necessarily mean it was weaker. My friend Liam, over at Thoughts of a Thousand Lives, summed up my internal debate perfectly: â€œâ€¦each of these books is different enough that itâ€™s extremely hard to compare them. All three of them sit pretty equally with me because of that, and the quality of the writing, worldbuilding, and character development never varies at all.â€
And thatâ€™s the crux of it â€“ all of the things Iâ€™ve come to expect from a Sanderson novel were there in abundance. Overall, Oathbringer contained all of the plot advancement and amazing moments Iâ€™d hoped to get out of it. Multiply that with the fact that the tome itself is a gorgeous piece of art filled with sketches and diagrams that enhance the story, and you have a reading experience unlike no other. I applaud Sandersonâ€™s ambition and commitment to this project, as I could see how he could have easily wrapped it up in this third book and left a few things unresolved (as many authors have done). What a delight that one of my favorite series on the market continues strong with many more novels to come. If you havenâ€™t ventured into this series yet, you are sorely missing out!
I want to say a HUGE thank you to the publicists at TOR/Forge and Brandon Sanderson for sending me an early copy of Oathbringer for review. You made my year! :D

,"Mystery, Fiction, Thriller, Suspense",THT Steph,"I have only read one other Chris Bohjalian book, and that was The Guest Room, where he took the oddest approach of something as serious as sex trafficking. I liked the writing style though, and with such a large fan base, I was willing to give him another go, but I think The Sleepwalker is where we part ways.
Now, some of you know that I love unlikable characters. There is so much to be done with them whether it be their own redemption, their undoing, what they teach me about myself when an author is crafty enough to get me to relate to those who I would ordinarily find no common ground with. Then there are just characters who never learn and have nothing to bring to the table for the characters around them, or to their reader. The Sleepwalker was riddled with just such characters. There was not one likeable character, not one with any redeeming quality, and not one who I learned anything from.
The main character, Lianna, from whose perspective the story is being told, is a hot mess. She is desperate for information about her mothers disappearance, desperate enough for a boyfriend, and kinky enough to involve herself with a man who has the oddest connection to her family, has his own serious problems, and is someone that any rational woman would steer clear of, but Lianna goes for him and ends up relishing the perversion, then being pissed about it, going back, etc. I really wish that I could be more clear, but it is a spoiler if I go further.
Then, there is this entire thing about sleep sex. I generally look up things when inspired by my reading, but the way that Bohjalian depicted this condition, I honestly don't want to know. I prefer to go on believing that the majority was a figment of his perverted mind, and it isn't at all how he has told it. If you know otherwise, keep it to yourself.
It was the end that saved this book from being an epic failure. The entire read is moving in a direction that the reader is seeing unfold slowly (very slowly), but it is literally the last three sentences of the book that changed what I thought I was seeing into something entirely different. That left me wowed, it really did. How unfortunate for me that everything that proceeded it, offered little to my liking.
NOTE: I am in the minority here...Again. You should know that as I write this post, there are 196 Goodreads ratings that are averaging 4-stars. Obviously other readers weren't as bothered with some of the things that I was, and you might not be either. Of course, this is a NetGalley offering, so one has to bare in mind that those titles often rate a pinch higher before release. (less)",Negatif
,"Romance, Contemporary, Contemporary Romance, Fiction, Womens Fiction, Chick Lit",Julie,"Lost and Found Sisters by Jill Shalvis is a 2017 William Morrow Paperbacks publication.
Unforgettable characters, whimsical and enchanting!
Shalvis out did herself with this one. Iâ€™ve sampled several of Shalvisâ€™ series, and I always enjoy any book she writes, but sometimes a book comes along that just hits the spot..
Quinn loves L.A., her job as a chef, has loving supportive parents, and a kind of -sort of â€“ boyfriend. But, over the past couple of years, she has only been going through the motions of life, unable to feel anything but a numbed grief.
But, a stunning revelation sends her away from big city life, to settle down for a while in the small town of Wildstone. Here, she meets Mick, another temporary transplant, and Tilly, a teenager in need of love and guidance, who has also suffered a deep loss.
Could the tiny, offbeat, and slightly supernatural, Wildstone, holds the key to awakening Quinn's long dormant zeal for life?
â€œIf itâ€™s got tires or testicles, itâ€™s gonna give you trouble. Wasnâ€™t that the truthâ€¦
I loved this story right from the beginning. The tone is a little different in this book, which has a paranormal element, and a quirky, almost whimsical quality to it. The trademark humor Shalvis is known for, was at its peak in this book, especially the hilarious musings from Tillyâ€™s journal that precedes each chapter.
But, how Shalvis manages to deal with the subject of death with such delicacy, I donâ€™t know. The story could have easily turned maudlin- but Shalvis never let it get too heavy, keeping everything light, with just the right emotional grabs, at just the right moments, for optimal effect, and believe me, it is effective!!
The emotional connections between sisters, family, and friends, combined with a sizzling romance, was outstanding!! While JS has combined friendship and family situations into her novels, usually the main focus in on the romance. In this case, the range is broader, and boy does it really pack a punch!
Quinn is so depressed after losing her sister, that her pain is a living, breathing thing. It was an amazing and powerful thing to watch her regain her footing, slowly come to life again, with gusto!!
Quinn is funny, loyal, and so easy to like. Mick, is also going through things that has him waffling about his role in Wildstone, and the romance often has a question mark at the end, but it is a very fun, tender and sweet relationship.
Lena, Mickâ€™s former girlfriend, was also a real pill, but despite everything I liked her and liked the way Quinn handled the situation. Maybe someday sheâ€™ll get her own story.
Tilly- well, she almost stole the show a few times and it was obvious, she and Quinn is cut from the same cloth.
There was another character present, whose loving spirit chimed in on occasion, which was very funny at times, but sweet and touching, as well. To add the icing on the cake, there are also a couple of adorable pets featured, making this story darned near perfect.
Jill Shalvis always writes lovely romantic stories, tinged with humor and heartfelt emotions, but this story really melted my troubled heart and reminded me of why these stories are so important, why we need them, and the positive way they influence, uplift and enrich our lives.

,"Plays, Fiction, Young Adult, Contemporary",Jamie (TheRebelliousReader),"5 stars. Half hilarious and half one continuous punch to the stomach. Amazing.
One thing about me, I am a huge fan of Broadway Musicals and I fell in love with the soundtrack to Dear Evan Hansen last year. I knew the story and since it's not likely I will ever see the show live (sobs) reading the screenplay was the closest thing for me I guess. I wasn't prepared. I was not prepared at all to sob the way that I did while reading this but it was worth it. It's a beautiful coming of age story with such a lovable and relatable main character. It deals with such heavy topics with such honesty and rawness that I commend Steven Lenson and he deserves all the success the show has garnered.
I really don't have anything else to say except to read it. If you haven't listened to the soundtrack do that too. You definitely won't regret it. Just be prepared for the emotional rollercoaster this will put you through. (less)",Positif

,"Romance, New Adult, Contemporary",Sabrina,"2.5 Stars
Despite my 2.5 Star rating, I did enjoy this story. Bliss and Nate had a romance that kept me interested and I did like them when the got together. But there were a lot of little things in this story that had me ready to pull my hair out and that's why my rating is so slow.
First, the name dropping in this book was making my head spin. I never read all of the Sea Breeze and Rosemary Beach books, but even if I had these random people and names popping up would still be way too much. There was no need for so many of the kids to make an appearance and it didn't even flow with the story, it just felt like the author was trying to get us interested in like 100 characters that I frankly couldn't give two shits about. They aren't the main characters so they can go. Just my opinion, but my memory is not that good to remember so many different characters, especially when some of the names are similar.
Then add in the fact that I hated Bliss. She was just too confusing as a heroine and I didn't understand her. There was seriously a scene where she told Nate that he needed to leave, and then when he went to leave she got mad that he was actually leaving. Bitch do you have an evil twin pretending to be you? I just found her to be immature so I never had a moment where I liked her.
Now here's the big thing. Where was the story? I felt like the book had no substance and it just bounced around with a few things and then the end. In the end I could look back and I liked seeing Bliss and Nate together, but while I was reading it was like there was no real direction their story was going in. And then the ending seemed really sudden after some drama happened and then bam it was all okay and over.
Overall, not my favorite book but not my worst either. I think this series and these characters just aren't for me, but I'll still read Abbi Glines' other series in the future. (less)",Negatif
,"Science Fiction, Thriller, Audiobook, Adult, Dystopia, Fantasy, Adventure ",Bradley,"Thanks to Netgalley for this ARC!
And a very special thanks to the author for writing Hard-SF in a really fun and engaging way. This is often much harder than it might seem at a casual glance.
Fortunately, the light tone and the clear explanations of the science prevailed and served only to propel the story forward. And what kind of story is it? It's a fast-paced thriller! And no, before you ask, this isn't a clone of Dark Matter. Far from it. We're dealing with a better version of Star Trek's transporter problem from a quantum entanglement viewpoint, and far from getting bogged down in an introductory reading of such a story, (which has been done a lot), we jump right ahead into the social and technological implications of a society that has come to accept it and the actuarial realities of checksumming your torrented self across great distances. How boring, right? But boring gets people moving, and moving, and moving... aaaand ... I really shouldn't spoil this, but all the cool stuff happens after the poop hits the fan from after this point.
Copy, paste, delete. We know the concept. No problem. Now skip the last step. Hello, me! :)
The author carries two PoV's wonderfully and keeps it light even when really bad things are happening. I loved it, from the marital problems to the chase, the ambulance, the AI, the conspiracy, the nutjobs AND the nutjobs, and of course, arguing with yourself. :) I like to think that I wouldn't have any such problems with myself, but let's be realistic here. A perfect teleportation clone is going to be competing with your resources right off the bat. There's a lot of real conflicts right there.
So, bravo! for keeping it real.
This was a very nice surprise. I asked for this one just on a whim and I am very pleased I did. I totally recommend this for all kinds of clone-fans who love thrillers. This one happens to be a lot better than most and I can say it feels rather more original than most. PLUS! It has the benefit of sticking close to real science to the best of our current understanding!
The same goes for all the multitudes of the great little idea-gems we visit in this future world. The carbon-sucking mosquitos are a delight. So are the self-driving cars that alert each other on emergency channels whenever some monkey is taking the wheel. :) Scary. :)

,"Romance, M M Romance, Sports and Games, Sports, Contemporary",Lisa,"5 Stars!
Harmless is the fourth book in Nicole Edwardsâ€™ MM series entitled Pier 70. In this series we have been introduced to the men who own and operate Pier 70 Marina â€“ Cam Strickland (featured in book one), Dare Davis (featured in book two), Teague Carter (featured in book three) and, finally, Roan Gregory. I always fall wholeheartedly in love with anything Ms. Edwards writes and if you know anything about her books you know that she tends to write about copious amounts of sexual variations (MF/MFM/MM, etc.) and you also know that her books are HOT AS FUCK as we watch each of the characters Ms. Edwards creates succumb to passion and love. I am certainly a huge fan and love the fact that this is her first entirely MM series! I love getting wrapped up in a sexy romance with enough emotional turmoil to fulfill any angst lover. This book definitely fit the bill as we watch two men who have surrounded themselves with secrets forge a path on the rocky road of lust and love.
To be honest with you, I had no idea where this author would take Roanâ€™s story. Ever since admitting to harboring secret feelings for his best friend and having it blow up in his face, Roan has been pushing away from his closest comrades. They have no idea what heâ€™s been dealing with when it comes to his drug-addicted sister and Roan does not want to share the burdens in his life. That is, until the unexpected happens and tragedy leaves Roan with no option but to finally open up to his best friends and letting them help.
Colton (â€œSegâ€) Seguine is a defenseman for the Austin Arrows NHL team. Heâ€™s fought hard for a successful career; however, it has not come without a price. Segâ€™s focus has always been on hockey leaving very little time for anything else, including romantic/lust-filled escapades. When Colton spies the sexiest man he has ever seen at a bar, he canâ€™t stop himself from approaching him. What begins as a one-night, sex-filled encounter leave both Seg and Roan craving more.
Neither Seg nor Roan is prepared for what begins to develop between them when they canâ€™t stop thinking about each other after they sizzling night and even after so much time passes. When they finally accept that what they shared is something they both want more of, it does not take long for their relationship to envelope both men into this complex whirlwind of emotions. So begins a complicated game of push and pull as they secretly spend time with each other in and out of bed. However, is Seg ready for someone like Roan to take up so much room in his life and in his heart especially when he can risk his career by coming out as gay? Roan already has so much on his own plate so can he deal with being someoneâ€™s secret in the midst of his own personal struggles? Both men have a lot to risk. Will they be brave enough to take a chance at a happy forever?
Roan and Seg certainly have a few obstacles to overcome. Both are hesitant to get in too deep with each other at first. Both men certainly realize there is a lot at risk. It takes more that lust and physical attraction to build a lasting relationship especially when there are so many issues that require attention. But, the heart wants what it wants and as our two protagonists get pulled in deeper and deeper, they discover that taking a risk may be the best thing they ever do.
This story is a sweet and emotional one. It is also a complex one as both Roan and Seg have a lot standing against them. It was not an easy road that they eventually embark on when it comes to being together; however, they both realize that the connection between them was something neither one of them could walk away from. And, really this should go without saying considering who the author is but there was no shortage of some down and dirty sexy times. Both men had this dominant edge that was extremely sexy. It made things interesting and HAWT, HAWT, HAWT!!!!! Seriously, read this one with caution. As a matter of fact, read any book by this author with caution. Or, at least have a fan handy. ;)
All in all, Harmless is a wonderful addition to this series that I absolutely adore. I loved getting a glimpse into the lives of the other characters featured in this series. We also get some other POVs which simply added to the story. I highly recommend this book and this entire series!

,"Thriller, Mystery, Horror, Fiction, Mystery Thriller",Kathryn,"In a culture of bespokeâ€¦..well, everything, Riley Sagerâ€™s Final Girls seemed tailor-made for this horror fangirl. The phrase â€˜Final Girlâ€™ is a widely-used trope in horror films that describes the last person standing who confronts the killer and WINS. Think Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween, Neve Campbell in SCREAM, or Heather Langenkamp in Nightmare on Elm Street. In Riley Sagerâ€™s book, she takes the Final Girls trope and translates it to a real-world setting. And while the book is undoubtedly compelling, itâ€™s ultimately disappointing. Basically, itâ€™s the literary equivalent of binging on sour patch kids [or insert your favorite sugary treat here]. It tastes good. You canâ€™t stop eating it. But when youâ€™re done, youâ€™re vaguely ill and feel curiously unsatisfied.
Final Girls centers around Quincy Carpenter, the lone survivor of â€˜The Pine Cottage Murders,â€™ a horrific event (almost like itâ€™s ripped from a horror movieâ€¦.BUM BUM BUM) where all her college besties were brutally stabbed to death. The murders make Quincy an overnight Nancy Grace sensation and the media dubs her a â€œFinal Girl.â€ This title places Quincy in an exclusive â€œclubâ€ with two other women who have similarly earned this distinction. Lisa Milner and Samantha Boyd. Fast-forward 10 years, Quincy is living with her lawyer boyfriend and running a successful baking blog. Sounds like she escaped relatively unscathed, right? WRONG. She be popping xanax like itâ€™s hot and hoarding random stolen shit. CRAZY. CAKES. When Quincy receives word that Lisa has died under questionable circumstance and Samantha abruptly shows up at her door, things quickly start to spin OUT. OF. CONTROL.
Final Girls has a great premise. Itâ€™s got all the ingredients for an amazing story. But itâ€™s justâ€¦..kind of a mess. Partly, itâ€™s because it never quite decides what it wants to be. Critical satire or legitimate thriller. Thereâ€™s clear reference to multiple horror movie tropes. Letâ€™s take a glance, shall we?
The Pine Cottage Murders are of the â€˜cabin in the woodsâ€™ oeuvre and occur adjacent to a psychiatric asylum. Two checkmarks. Spoiled, rich, obnoxious white kids rent said cabin for weekend of drink and debauchery. Third and Fourth checkmark for no diversity and â€œimmoral activity.â€ Quincyâ€™s friend informs gang about previous murder in the area. This mention establishes ominous tone. Fifth checkmark. Janelle, the birthday girl and trip organizer, is portrayed as an oversexed exhibitionist. Sixth checkmark for â€œslutty chick.â€ Hello, morality police. A cell phone ban has been placed. Seventh checkmark: no ability to get help. Then, a mysterious and oddly behaved stranger arrives. Seventh checkmark. FINALLY, we have Quincy. An intelligent, kind, virginal, non-drinker, non-drug user. Best friend to slutty chick. Ladies & gentlemen, please give a hand for ourâ€¦...FINAL GIRL. AND our eighth checkmark. Et voila, a horror movie, in all its conservative, moralistic, misogynistic glory, is born.
The present day Quincy-Samantha storyline plays out another familiar horror trope, that of the standard Single White Female. Samantha enters the scene abruptly, things are all peachy keen until she gradually takes over Quincyâ€™s life. Ominous warnings about Sam are given by concerned third parties, followed by Samâ€™s behavior growing quickly more erratic.
Now, I have no issue with Final Girls constructing a story entirely around tropes. In fact, itâ€™s kinda what I expected. But when a writer so heavily references another work there needs to be SOME humor present. Here, thereâ€™s none. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Itâ€™s devoid of anything remotely funny. All the horror cliches are used, but only with the utmost gravity. So the novel reads more like an inferior knock-off than a satire. And itâ€™s too bad because itâ€™s possible to meld both satire and suspense, look at SCREAM & Cabin in the Woods. Both poke fun at the scary movie genre, while retaining the creep factor.
Yes, as promised there are plot twists. Final Girls delivers on that. I was genuinely surprised at the end, but not happily. I love a good twist. But Final Girls clearly valued SHOCK and AWE over consistent characterization. A surprise ending doesnâ€™t work if thereâ€™s no build up, logic, or cohesion. You canâ€™t rip off a mask, declare someone a killer, and end story. This ainâ€™t Scooby Doo, kids.
And FFS...can writers STOP using the repressed memory device??!! PLEASE??!! Itâ€™s such lazy writing. Oh, and the Central Park sidestory? Completely unnecessary. It didnâ€™t serve the plot and was a distraction from the primary narrative. What a waste of time. UGH.
So basicallyâ€¦..Final Girls was readable. So readable I stayed up until 6AM. But it so wasnâ€™t worth it. It wasnâ€™t badâ€¦.it just wasnâ€™t anything and Iâ€™m sad because it had the potential to beâ€¦.SOMETHING.

But Aza's character felt super realistic and I am so impressed right now. This was honestly one of the best depictions of anxiety or any mental health battle I've ever read. It didn't sound like someone trying to write the concept... John Green has clearly lived this. It was incredibly raw, honest, and beautiful at times.
I think everyone will relate to this on some level because the story grapples with the types of realizations we all face while growing up (so it's kind of reassuring that we're not alone in those thoughts). Aza spends a lot of time examining to what extent we author our lives and what our definition of ""self"" involves. But then she gets stuck in obsessive, infinitely tightening thought spirals that are SO well depicted.
""It's getting sucked into a whirlpool that shrinks and shrinks and shrinks your world until you're just spinning without moving, stuck inside a prison cell that is exactly the size of you, until eventually you realize that you're not actually in a prison cell. You are the prison cell.""
""True terror isn't being scared; it's not having a choice in the matter.""
John Green articulated so many situations and struggles incredibly well. And even though he had his characters muse over how there aren't really ways in English to describe the pain or struggle, he somehow managed to convey it quite vividly.
The book did feel like more of a character study at times, though. The story itself wasn't particularly gripping and I wasn't really that interested in whatever was happening outside of Aza's thoughts. I think it just tried to cover too many different potential plots in less than 300 pages. But the mental health aspect more than made this worth the read! Everything Ava pondered worked together really well to have a larger impact (especially the bits on different parasitic thoughts/beings).
I was grateful that the book didn't talk down to the audience OR get too pretentious while covering some of the fascinating strings of thought. The philosophical conversations were one of my favorite parts because they felt so natural. And the way that the typical ""turtles all the way down"" imagery fit into this particular story was really neat.
I also liked how the book's tone could've easily gotten bleak or tried to put some hollow positive spin on everything, but instead did a great job tackling everything head on in a way that felt really authentic. I am SO glad that this wasn't some cure narrative where Aza gets into a relationship and starts going about life after she's ""better."" She's just living realistically.
""...nothing in this world is deserved except for love, that love is both how you become a person, and why.""
So this wasn't the typical John Green romance with quirky teens, but that ended up being a refreshing change for me. And even though I wasn't terribly into the overall story as a whole, I still really appreciated the depiction of Aza's mental health. Obviously everyone's personal experience is different (so it's not necessarily ""wrong"" if it doesn't speak for you), but I do think this will resonate with a lot of readers!! (less)",Positif
,"Science Fiction, Fiction, Fantasy, Dystopia",Ace,"Finally a Vandermeer novel that I not only enjoyed reading, but understood. It has a start, middle and an end. Itâ€™s not a part of a trilogy pretending to be a complete book. Itâ€™s a full story, a great yarn and a scary look at a possible future for us.
For the first time, I am gripped by a JV novel, glued to the pages and the spine chilling story. Those in the know will know what I mean when [she] walks into the pool room and Wick is talking to Rachel. Even though I knew it was coming, it still sent a giant shiver down my spine and rose every single hair on my scared little body. That is masterful writing.

,"Mystery, Fiction, Contemporary, Thriller, Mystery Thriller, Adult",karen,"until the ending, this was probably going to be a three star from me. a high three on the three-star spectrum, but a three nonetheless. it held my interest, but i think this one will resonate more with theater-kids than it did for me, because of how firmly entrenched it is in that world. rio makes it accessible to regular folk, but it probably helps to have a soft place in your heart for young actors and the things that drive them, and iâ€™m someone impatient with affectation both in life and in my reading, so the characters were frequently more grating than charming to me. theyâ€™re definitely convincing for who they are, but i never warmed to any of them or felt sympathetic towards them - iâ€™ve certainly known people like this in my life, but itâ€™s exhausting to be confronted with seven of them at once, all posturing and pretentious banter, where conversations are on-the-nose passages from shakespeareâ€™s plays shot back-and-forth, displaying the characters' education, not necessarily their personality.
iâ€™m with the detective (the first speaker) in this scene:
â€So,â€ he says. â€œHow much of what you told me about that night was true?â€
â€œAll of it,â€ I say, â€œin one way or another.â€
A pause. â€œAre we going to play this game?â€
â€Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true,â€ I say.
â€œI thought they would have beaten that bullshit out of you in prison.â€
â€œThat bullshit is all that kept me going.â€ One thing Iâ€™m sure Colborne will never understand is that I need language to live, like food - lexemes and morphemes and morsels of meaning nourish me with the knowledge that, yes, there is a word for this. Someone else has felt this before.
â€œWhy donâ€™t you just tell me what happened? No performance. No poetics.â€
â€œFor us, everything was a performance.â€ A small, private smile catches me off guard and I glance down, hoping he wonâ€™t see it. â€œEverything poetic.â€
Colborne is quiet for a moment and then says, â€œYou win. Tell it your way.â€
to backtrack, this book is a variant on The Secret History theme - it features seven theater students in their fourth year at a very elite arts college whose discipline is strictly shakespeare. they live together in an appropriately dramatic castle-like structure, slightly off the main campus - inseparable from each other, isolated from 'normal' people, and constantly immersed in tragedies filled with feuds, vengeance, and casual murders. further complications result from the particulars of the actorâ€™s temperament:
â€A good Shakespearian actor - a good actor of any stripe, really - doesnâ€™t just say words, he feels them. We all felt the passions of the characters we played as if they were our own. But a characterâ€™s emotions donâ€™t cancel out the actorâ€™s - instead you feel both at once. Imagine having all your own thoughts and feelings tangled up with all the thoughts and feelings of a whole other person. It can be hard, sometimes, to sort out which is which.â€
considering this perfect storm of elements, itâ€™s not surprising when life and art get blurred and one of them ends up dead. but is it the result of an accident or murrrrrderrrr? the events of that night are murky, but our verbiage-spouting narrator oliver marks confessed to the murder and has spent the past ten years in jail. his release coincides with the retirement of detective colborne, the lead investigator in the case, and oliver is ready to tell colborne exactly what happened that night. his way.
the story is split between oliver â€˜now,â€™ returning to the scene of the crime with colborne, and the story of everything that went on in this cult-like group ten years ago; of a group of people obsessed with shakespeare whose relationships with each other were as complicated as any tragedy - resentments and rivalries, sexual dalliances, unrequited longing, blood relatives and lovers, straight and gay, addictions and insecurities and the fine line between acting and lying, onstage combat and real-life consequences.
itâ€™s a debut, so thereâ€™s some first-timer clumsiness in terms of exposition - the first chapter, introducing all the players is kind of tedious, but it definitely picks up once it gets over the basic stage-setting. the scenery-chewing shakespeare stuff is a bit indulgent; shakespeare ends up doing a lot of the narrative work in what is often a pretty straightforward story, if youâ€™ve read a lot of The Secret History type books, but thereâ€™s one interesting spin on the story: usually the narrator in these books takes the â€˜outsider looking inâ€™ role, typically separated from the group at large because of a lower socio-economic status, but in this case - yes, oliver is much less well-off than most of his peers, but i think each of the characters could claim outsider status for one reason or another, and the group is less cohesive than The Secret History norm (although it does mirror the character checklist of two (view spoiler) relatives; cousins, not twins, one gay male, and one major asshole)
it's a good read; if you're a The Secret History readalike addict like me, it's not going to blow your mind, but it's entertaining, and i did really like the little turn at the end. it opens up a lot of questions about what will happen next, but it was a nice little surprise in a story i thought had already ended.

,"Young Adult, Contemporary, Realistic Fiction, Fiction, Disability",Emily May,"I really struggled to finish this book. At less than 300-pages it should have been a breeze, but it took me so long to push through.
One problem, perhaps, is that I chose the wrong kind of story for me. I like it when art is a subplot in a book - used for expressing oneself or for escapism - but I am often bored by books that focus almost entirely on art. I have no personal interest in different types of paint and the techniques required to turn them into something beautiful. I don't get anything out of art lessons about still life, or wheatpaste. I need something more.
And there isn't really anything. More, that is. You're Welcome, Universe's plot is about a graffiti war between the Deaf protagonist, Julia, and some mystery artist who keeps painting over her work. I guess it all depends on how interesting a graffiti war sounds to you as a reader.
As far as I can tell as an able-bodied individual, the author has done a lot of research on d/Deaf culture and spent time with a number of Deaf beta readers. Also consider checking out this review by a Deaf reader. What Julia is unable to realistically lip-read is shown by blanks in the dialogue, and Gardner gives consideration to details, such as when Julia tries to determine what kind of music Beatles songs are by the lyrics, and everyday microaggressions.
But I think my problem with this book was how bratty, petty, and selfish Julia was. I couldn't stand her. And not only that, but the way her actions are so easily swept under the rug without consideration. She goes around vandalizing other people's property, slut-shaming a girl for being ""easier"" after she apparently ""stole Donovan"", lying to everyone, and stomping around when she doesn't get her own way.
Julia is horrible to everyone in the book. I couldn't understand why so many people continued trying to befriend her. Sometimes people are moody and they screw up, but it was never treated like Julia did actually screw-up. And I was horrified by that scene where (view spoiler)

Fun . . . Fun . . . Fun! Glorious, imaginative fun!
This enchanted tale (a story within THE story) was indeed a delight. Belle became ""Lost in a Book"", as did I. And oh what a mesmorizing journey, with Belle and Beast, and the usual Disney cast: Chip, Mrs. Potts, Lumiere, Cogsworth . . . and some new characters too, like the spellbinding sisters: Love and Death.
""Sometimes words alone were not enough, because they spoke only to the head. But a story, one in which the words were strung together as beautifully as pearls on a necklace . . . that would speak to the heart.""
More than words on a page, this was a grand adventure. Charming, gallant, lovely, magical, and a wee bit frightful and gothic - like the original fairytale.
""Stumbling and tripping, Belle ran down the path. Her dress caught on a branch. She tore it free . . . A roar ripped through the night. It was followed by a second one . . . She turned a corner and continued down the path, following it as it snaked off farther into the maze.""
Jennifer Donnelly is quite the diversified, noteworthy author. Lost in a Book - a story of her own creation - is sure to become a timeless classic for young and the young-at-heart to enjoy for years, and years to come.
And certainly recommendable now. My only negative critique: poor line-editing and a slight rushed feel towards the end resulting in Donnelly's less than usual wordsmith finesse. As if she rushed to meet her deadline, or perhaps, the deadline was moved up to coincide with the latest reimagined cinematic release of Beauty and the Beast. Regardless, it's a delightful story and I'm thrilled to have been enchanted by it.

Lisa See has made me very happy. She can always be trusted to provide historical pieces that both entertain and inform the reader. So even though the only tea I care to drink is Arizona Zero Calorie Green with Ginseng, I now know more about making tea in China than I could ever imagine, and I loved reading about the ancient customs and superstitions of the mountain people known as the Akha.

Li-Yan was forced to leave her firstborn daughter with an orphanage, from which the baby was later adopted by white Americans. Li-Yan was intent on making it as an educated tea seller, while always wondering about the baby she gave up. Although most pages are dedicated to Li-Yan's story, we also get to know the little girl as she matures into a young Chinese - American scholar, curious about her Chinese heritage and especially the tea cake that accompanied her into the orphanage as a baby.

,"Romance, Contemporary Romance, Contemporary",Aestas Book Blog,"::: FULL REVIEW NOW POSTED :::
Youâ€™ve always had my heart, Emmy. Weâ€™re it for each other. I thought about you every day for nine years.
WOW!!! This book was pure Alpha romance perfection!! I loved every single word and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a gorgeous, sexy, well-written second chance romance that will make your heart race as two estranged lovers who were married in a whirlwind ceremony are reunited after a nine year long separation only to find that the intensity of the love they shared is just strong as they day they were separated...
After falling in love with Devney Perry's writing earlier this year in The Coppersmith Farmhouse (my review), I was incredibly excited to read whatever she wrote next! While each book in this series is a standalones, the characters are all part of a small town and so there are delightful crossovers and cameos that are a treat to any reader who is familiar with the couples from previous books. New readers however can jump right in too.
The Clover Chapel was Nick and Emmy's book. Their story began nine years ago in Vegas where one wild night led to an spontaneous marriage between these two strangers from opposite sides of the country who shared little in common other than their undeniable attraction to each other and sparking chemistry. But when Emmy woke up the next morning, her gorgeous new husband Nick was gone leaving nothing behind but a note.
Nearly a decade later, she needed an escape from the stifling city life she'd never even wanted. Finally determined to pursue a career she'd always dreamed about, she accepted a teaching post in a small town and her whole world turned upside down when she arrived and came face to face with long lost husband.
Nick had regretted leaving her since the moment he'd walked away and even though he'd done so for noble reasons, now that he was facing a second chance with the only woman he had ever loved, he was determined to do everything in his power to win back her trust and give them the happily ever after they'd always deserved...
She took a dare and fell in love. Truth would have been the smarter choice.
After years of living under her fatherâ€™s thumb, Emmeline is ready to break free. Sheâ€™s abandoned her life as a New York socialite to follow her dream of becoming a kindergarten teacher in a small, wholesome town. Seeing the man that nearly broke her was absolutely not what she had hoped to find in Prescott, Montana.
Nick hasnâ€™t seen his Emmy in nine years, but that doesnâ€™t mean heâ€™s forgotten a thing about the woman he loves. After just one blissful night as man and wife, he gave her up, sacrificing his own happiness to keep her safeâ€”far away from him. But the moment she walks back into his lonely life is the moment he decides never to let her go again. He wonâ€™t waste his second chance. All he has to do is win back Emmelineâ€™s heart, keep her safe from the shadows in his past and prove to her that taking a wager on him is a sure bet.
OH MY HEAVENS, YOU GUYS!!! There was SO MUCH SWOON in this book! I swear to you, Nick will melt your heart over and over and over and over again! Ahhhh even just that moment when they first saw each other again after such a long separation was pure, palm-tingling book magic!
Devney Perry's books deliver that exact perfect balance between everything I love to read about in romance. Her writing FLOWS effortlessly -- it's brimming with emotions and sensual heat, and manages to be equally character and plot driven. Once I started reading this book, I just didn't want to put it down even for a minute.
â€œIf you keep looking at my mouth, Iâ€™m going to kiss you,â€ he said.
I absolutely loved that even though they'd been separated for over nine years, Nick treated her with such deep love and respect even from the start of their reunion. He had been the one to leave her in Vegas and that guilt weighed heavily on his shoulders. But he'd had a solid reason for doing so -- right or wrong, at the time he truly believed it was the only way to protect her. But now that she'd come into his life again, he wasn't going to let her go until he'd shown her the depth of his love.
â€œEmmy.â€
â€œEmmeline!â€
â€œEmmy. Youâ€™ll always be my Emmy.â€
â€œIâ€™m not your anything, Nick.""
â€œYouâ€™re my wife.â€
â€œA paper certificate does not make me your wife,â€ I said.
His frame deflated and his eyes filled with regret. â€œForgive me. Give us a chance. We have something here and you know Iâ€™m rightâ€¦ Your heart still belongs to me.â€
My heart broke for Nick even while I understood Emmy's reluctance to trust him. But anyone who reads even one page of these two together will be able to see without a shadow of a doubt that they were soul mates.
â€œI want a chance,â€ Nick said.
â€œA chance for what?â€ I asked.
â€œA chance to start again.â€
My mouth fell open. Was he serious? â€œWhat? Why?â€
â€œYou asked me back then if I believed in fate. I didnâ€™t until I met you. And Iâ€™ve spent nine years thinking Iâ€™d never see your face again. But fate brought you back into my life and Iâ€™m not going to mess it up again.â€
I struggled to swallow the lump in my throat and speak. â€œYou left me.â€
â€œPlease believe I did it for a good reason. And not a day has gone by when I havenâ€™t regretted it.â€
To be honest, I find it's really rare to come across an Alpha male romance that is done this right. A true Alpha hero in my eyes has a delicate balance between possessiveness and protectiveness, he's a bit overbearing but only because he cares so much but is also sweet and caring, loving and sexy. Different Alpha heroes have different measures of those qualities but, to me, the books in this series have the perfect balance of everything.
â€œIâ€™m sorry. I am so fucking sorry, Emmy,â€ he whispered, peppering my hands with kisses.
â€œWhy didnâ€™t you tell me any of this?â€ I asked. â€œYou could have told me back then. We could have worked something out.â€
â€œBecause I knew that if I looked into your eyes again, I would never let you go. And you were too good for that life. You needed someone who could give you so much more than I ever couldâ€¦ Youâ€™ve always had my heart, Emmy.""
Nick's devotion to Emmy was utterly heart-melting -- especially the way he wouldn't let anything come between them. Honestly, I can't tell you how much I appreciated what a functional couple they were. Sure, they each made mistakes -- who doesn't? -- but it was clear that they both respected and loved each other enough to work together to get through every hurdle they came across.
â€œI thought about you every day for nine years, wondering what you were doing. I had questions I wanted to ask but couldnâ€™t. Those nine years are on me. It was my mistake to walk away from you but Iâ€™m not doing it again. And I wonâ€™t let you do it either. All Iâ€™m asking for is time. Iâ€™ll prove to you that you can trust me again.â€
I feel like I could read this series forever and there are so many couples and characters with stories to tell in this town so I'm incredibly excited for all the next books! I seriously want to read everyone's story!
While this book is undeniably a Romance, there is also another more suspenseful storyline running parallel to the love story and I was equally wrapped up in both sides of this story. But let me tell you -- things got INTENSE towards the end! My heart raced and pounded and I flipped those pages so fast that I barely took time to breathe.
â€œI havenâ€™t gotten to travel much, but of all the places Iâ€™ve been, itâ€™s my second favorite.â€
â€œWhatâ€™s your first?â€
His arms hugged me tighter. â€œThe Clover Chapel.â€
I'm not going to lie, it's pretty rare for me to rate a book 5 stars but honestly, I literally loved every single thing about this book. The romance, the writing, the story, the characters, the setting, the emotions, the humor, the suspense, the heat, the heart, everything was perfect. So far, both books in this series are in my Top 5 Favorites of 2017!
Devney Perry's writing is top notch. If you'd told me this was her tenth book rather than her second, I would have absolutely believed you. There's a flawless quality to the way her stories flow and a raw honesty to her characters that are at the heart of what has made me fall in love with her writing.
If you're looking for an addictive second chance romance that'll keep your heart racing, a swoony Alpha hero who'll sweep you off your feet, and a strong sassy heroine who'll make you smile, then I highly recommend this book!!

,"Fiction, Science Fiction, Abandoned, Dystopia",Julie,"DNF at 23% (circa 150 pages). I got much further this time than KSR's 2312, which I languished in for the 2013 Hugos -- which is apropos, considering I tried tackling this book for the 2018 awards.
I was going to soldier on, because there were glimmers of things that I really liked: Inspector Gen, Vlade, and Charlotte, and their sleuthing what was going on around their skyscraper; the street urchins (or ""water rats"") scurrying about their business; Amelia transporting polar bears. But that was offset by the things I outright loathed: the pages upon pages of dry, dull financial exposition. Franklin as a POV character, period. I don't like being around shallow chauvinistic horndog finance bros, so being in the head of one was even worse -- and I've really enjoyed novels with loathsome narrators before, but this is just so dry that it's not even interesting; he's just boring. I started skimming pages, which was the first warning sign, but then I hit a brick wall of fury at this metatextual authorial fourth-wall-breaking during one of the ""citizen"" chapters:
But pause ever so slightly--and those of you anxious to get back to the narrating of the antics of individual humans can skip to the next chapter, and know that any more expository rants, any more info dumps (on your carpet) from this New Yorker will be printed in red ink to warn you to skip them (not)--pause, broader-minded more intellectually flexible readers, to consider why the First Pulse happened in the first place.
That aside might be tongue-in-cheek, it might be self-aware about the book's own propensity towards hideous info dumps, but that doesn't make it cute. It also feels incredibly smug and condescending towards the readers who do want, yanno, characters and plot. I don't appreciate being called closed-minded by the book I'm reading, so fuck this, I'm officially out. It should be possible to write a compelling post-apocalyptic world that sings out about environmental devastation without being quite so snotty about it. Kim Stanley Robinson, I just don't think you and I are compatible. (less)",Negatif

What I love about Vi Keeland is that her books always manage to hook me from the beginning and keep me hanging on until the very end. That's what Egomaniac did to me.
Drew Jagger is a lawyer who practices on his own. When he returned to his office from his Hawaii vacation, he was shocked to find out that there's a stranger inside and it's a woman with a fiery red hair. When Emerie Rose saw him, she was horrified and she instantly threatened him to go away because she's going to call a cop. She then claimed that it's her office and she's been staying there for a while now. Turns out that she rented the place and paid a large sum of money to a scammer!
It's my first time to read a book where both characters have opposing nature of work (Drew as a divorce attorney and Emerie as a marriage counselor) and I loved it because it showed a unique characterization. The romance was wonderfully done. Vi Keeland did an amazing job building a great chemistry between Drew and Emerie. Man, these two are quite a pair! The only thing that I didn't quite like was Drew's attitude. There were multiple places throughout the story where he was a bit conceited. Well, duh. The title shows it eh? I didn't see any character development with him, though, and I wished his ""egomaniac"" ways were somehow lessened as the story goes.
Having said that, I loved how balanced this book was. It started out cute and entertaining and in the middle part, it became sweet. Then there were little conflicts from Drew's past that, thank God, didn't ruin the story. Those conflicts made Drew and Emerie become a good team. I enjoyed watching them work their issues out.
As this book fell into the workplace romance trope, the way they worked together in one place where it's fueled with sexual tension was a bit crazy, too. In a good way. I loved this book as a whole!

I don't know but I kinda expect an Alien Assassin to be more moody and broody, you know?
It was pretty short so obviously it lacked a lot of the details and the ""romance"" just didn't click.
Can't believe I'm saying this, there's a first time for everything but this was kinda stockholm-y.
I blame the length.
(Of the book. Hello?! Get your head outta the gutter.)
Personally I think I'd be working too hard not to pee my pants to consciously notice that a particular alien's stare was sorta different from the others.
Just saying, my thoughts would not be the same as our h's if I were being dragged around an alien prison where the inmates just ate one of their own and a seven foot blue alien with horns smiled at me.

,"Childrens, Picture books, War, Animals, Cultural ",Shelle Perry,"There is a fine line to walk when writing for children about the horror and deprivation of war, especially when that story is about a child of the same age. The author needs to inspire empathy and understanding without causing anxiety for the young readers. In My Beautiful Birds, Del Rizzo has done a masterful job of straddling that line and in doing so has not only given a beautiful story, but also a teachable moment for kids ages 4-10.
In this story, young Sammi and his family are forced to flee their home in order to avoid falling bombs. While seeing the destruction going on around him he is concerned for the pet birds that had to be left behind. His story continues when his family reaches the refugee camp where they will be living. Like the rest of the residents of the camp, he and family find a way to make the best of this horrible situation. There is hope in the people he meets along the way and the birds that he befriends around the camp.
I am not even going to be shy about admitting that I had no idea what this book was about when I picked it up. I simply judged this book as â€œneed to readâ€ by the positively stunning artwork on the cover, art that has been perfectly described as dimensional illustrations. I am fond of using a euphemism for â€˜leaping off the pageâ€™ when it comes to talking about art in childrenâ€™s books, but that is such pale terminology for what this book offers. If there were no text to tell the reader what is happening in the story, the reader would still be pulled in to Sammiâ€™s world; Birds fly, the smell of smoke fills the air, you can feel the grit of the sand and the hear the rasping of canvas tents. Sammiâ€™s fears and hopes have been rendered in infinite detail with this beautifully textured sculpted art.
The war in Syria and other parts of the world are in the news almost nightly. In addition to being a wonderful story, this book can also be a tool to explain to little ones about the war and the people it affects. It is told in a way that is completely accessible to kids and adults alike. It would make an excellent addition to any classroom library shelf.
I am looking forward to Del Rizzoâ€™s latest release, in the fall, A World of Kindness

,"Fiction, War, Cultural, Iran, Contemporary, Realistic Fiction",Alan Rice,"Khadivi's style is compelling. She recreates a California teen's voice with rapier-point accuracy, and delves the mercurial mind of her main character, Rez, with remarkable insight. As we follow Rez through his high school years, his initiation - and then obsession - with sex and drugs, his friendships, his complex relationship with his father, we are at once appalled by his bad choices and yet hopeful that his good nature will overcome his confused but compelling appetites. We keep hoping for a redeeming outcome, a happy ending. We want Rez to come to terms with his thoroughly American life, while embracing his Persian heritage.
Khadivi does not give in to those desires, however. What happens, happens, and the narrator prepares us by leading us mercilessly through Rez's convoluted, emotion-twisted reasoning.
At times, the narrative stumbles. The villains are often too stereotyped; the conflicts too predictable. Consequently, Khadivi's attempt to create a plausible explanation of how a nice, smart, successful, Americanized son of rich Iranian parents could be drawn into the shadowy world of ISIS is not always convincing. But there are many redeeming aspects of the book, as well. Khadivi has a sharp eye, and her ability to create a scene with a few choice details is outstanding, as is her ability to draw us into her protagonist's world, and ache with him as he struggles to find his true self.

,"Lgbt, Young Adult, contemporay, Romance",Megan Collene,"NOPE.
After almost an entire book of biphobic remarks, Konigsberg does NOT get to have a character casually drop â€œbisexual invisibilityâ€ into a conversation in the last ten pages of the story.
Like, WHAT?!
Yargh. Okay, let me begin again.
I have been so excited for this book. I loved Ben when I read Openly Straight, and like many, I wanted to see the continuation of his story. I was so excited that, two days ago, I actually went to the book release party, but after reading the blurb at the bottom of the cover and hearing Konigsberg speak, I started to get a bad feeling. During the Q&A portion, I wanted to ask about the authorâ€™s research into LGBTQ+ communities different from his own, but I chickened out. Now Iâ€™m upset I didnâ€™t; it seems like Konigsberg didnâ€™t do his research or ignored ongoing complaints of the bisexual community.
I read the majority of the book yesterday; it was a polarizing experience to be reading this while #BiTwitter was trending and being celebrated. If you recall from Openly Straight, it is Ben who first questions â€œMaybe weâ€™re bi?â€ in an intimate moment with Rafe, so why is the term so taboo in this instillation?
This book perpetuates a lot of bisexual myths, whether through outright discussion or subtle inferences. Many of the characters who claim to be accepting say seemingly ignorant things that arenâ€™t discussed further. A few myths (with corresponding page numbers) are:
1. Bisexual people find every person attractive (p. 52).
2. Bisexuality is a â€œphaseâ€ or a â€œtransitionary periodâ€ for one to becoming gay (p. 96).
3. Bi/pansexuality is determined by what genders you have experiences with (p. 143).
4. Bisexuality means youâ€™re half gay and half heterosexual (p. 233, 246).
5. Bisexuals are â€œconfusedâ€ or â€œcanâ€™t make up their mindâ€ (p. 134-7).
6. Bisexuals cannot be monogamous (p. 144).
Ben is a smart kid. Readers know from both Openly Straight and Honestly Ben that the character is fond of learning, and heâ€™s often shown reading or studying. However, there is no researching sexuality beyond a brief mention of looking up pictures of buff, naked men. This lack of exploration is actually really out of character for Ben, who I would probably label â€œheteroflexible,â€ even though he says he â€œstraightâ€ and just â€œgay-for-Rafe.â€ Yes, self-definition is more important than external labels, but Ben seems to have some internalized biphobia that isnâ€™t dealt with in the same way that homophobia is discussed in the book. I wouldnâ€™t be mad that Ben doesnâ€™t identify as bisexual if not for a glaring contradiction in the book. Multiple times in both books, Ben says that heâ€™s never thought about other men, but at the end of Honestly Ben, Rafe says that heâ€™s mentioned it before. Benâ€™s rationalization about the â€œfleeting thoughtsâ€ are that â€œ[heâ€™s] a human being. [Heâ€™s] curious about a lot of things.â€ THEN WHY ARENâ€™T YOU LOOKING THIS STUFF UP, BEN?! Ben saying that bisexuality â€œdoesnâ€™t feel rightâ€ is problematic because, as a scholar, he would have actively sought an answer. Instead, weâ€™re left with one resounding conclusion: bisexuality doesnâ€™t feel right.
Was this the intention? Iâ€™d hope not. But itâ€™s monosexist and problematic.
Why is this important? Well, first, of course, representation matters. Itâ€™s really hard to find good YA with bisexual characters, and Iâ€™m actually really sad that I canâ€™t say this is one of them. Additionally, though, itâ€™s important to note that Ben actually deals with issues that many bisexuals deal with. Bisexual youth are more likely to struggle with anxiety or depression than any other LGBTQ+ population, and itâ€™s not explored nearly enough in the book, but Konigsberg shows hints of Ben developing both. Additionally, bisexuals are often marginalized from the larger LGBTQ+ community. The boys of Natickâ€™s GSA apparently believe the myth that bisexuality is simply a phase leading to homosexuality. By not ever labeling Ben as bisexual, Konigsberg misses an opportunity to develop and explore these issues.
As his book release, Konigsberg mentioned the possibility of a third book in which the new information about Toby is explored. After this disappointment, though, I hope that doesnâ€™t happen.

,"Fiction, Mystery, Contemporary",Liz Barnsley,"I read this in one sitting because the writing was beautifully done and I appreciated the way Susan Perablo enveloped you into the plot as a reader - starting with a traumatic event and then showing us the aftermath through the eyes of one mother and her daughter.
The Fall of Lisa Bellow is a wonderfully deep character exploration, a book that give you a real sense of feeling about the characters in it - Meredith had a quirky outlook from the start and seeing that change and alter after the event was utterly compelling. Claire, Mum, too now having to deal with a problem befalling her second child after her first had already suffered was cleverly drawn, occasionally unlikable but doing her best to stay standing.
It is a gentle story in a lot of ways despite the violent event that kicks it off - a kind of rolling picture reel of different senses and feelings - there is somewhat of a disconnect, in fact the character I related most to was Meredith's brother Evan - a quiet and steady background influence.
I think it may suffer from its description. This is not a thriller. It is not even really a mystery and there are no real resolutions as is realistic to most things in life. So don't go into it expecting those things. This is a strong, emotive family drama, an exploration of recovery and an insightful glance into a modern, middle class family whose lives have taken an unexpected turn.
Definitely recommended for fans of Literary character study.

However just like the prequel short story which I reviewed earlier today, its writing seems off and just doesnâ€™t seem right. Itâ€™s far better than the prequel short story though. I donâ€™t want to discourage Mr. McCarrick from writing more because the foundation is here with great characters and the possibility of a great world.

RESEÃ‘A DE RELECTURA!
Olvida todo lo que dije sobre TDP la primera vez que lo leÃ­. Es una maravilla.

RESEÃ‘A ORIGINAL!
""As long as Gods shall live, so long shall I love you""
Voy a manejar porcentajes en este review porque me siento matemÃ¡tico af.
Ok, para empezar, debo decir que este libro no me gustÃ³. No. Lo siento. Pero en un 75% del libro no pASÃ“ NADA! Nada.
De verdad que estoy decepcionada del resultado. La espera y relectura de The Hidden Oracle (al que sÃ­ le di las 5 estrellas porque es perfecto) me subieron muchÃ­simo mÃ¡s las expectativas de The Dark Prophecy, y aquÃ­ estamos: yo, dÃ¡ndole 2/3 estrellas a otra novela y ustedes leyendo mis reseÃ±as hater de libros que en teorÃ­a debÃ­ amar.
Ahora sÃ­ comenzarÃ©.
""You don't have to be a god. Just do your best to your friends""
Apollo: Honestamente, Apollo ya me cansÃ³. Lo amo y siento una gratitud inmensa a Ã©l por ser mi godly daddy pero, ya me cansÃ©. Este fue Ã©l durante el libro: 25% renegando de su condiciÃ³n mortal y queriendo ser un dios de nuevo porque ser humano apesta; 25% llorando por sus amores perdidos; 50% vomitando. Ese es Ã©l. Aunque debo decir que esas cosas lo hacen un personaje real y creÃ­ble, pero, hasta ahÃ­. Creo que cinco libros es mucho. No sÃ©, Ãºltimamente nada me sorprende.
Otra cosa, yo AMO A LOS LGBT+! Los amo. Pero ya, Rick, un 80% de la poblaciÃ³n en sus libros es comunidad lgbt+, ya casi no quedan heterosexuales en el Riorduniverso o como se llama. En TDP, estÃ¡n Apollo, mas gay que la vaina; (view spoiler).
""He jokes more when he's nervous. He also jokes worse when he's nervous""

""I cannot give up, Apollo/Meg needs me""
Meg: Amo a Meg pero aquÃ­ no tanto. No sÃ©, perdiÃ³ su esencia. La amo y espero que tenga un hermoso destino como Persephone o algo, no sÃ©, ya no sÃ© ni quÃ© esperar de Rick. Nada. Nada de nada.
(view spoiler)
De todas formas la amo y amo sus maneras de ser y pensar. Eso de usar chia y el miedo a las serpientes me encanta <3
""We only fail when we stop trying""
El plot: No me gustÃ³ el plot, ni el villano, ni nada de eso. Commodus prometÃ­a pero despuÃ©s si lo que querÃ­a era dominar una ciudad entera, me pareciÃ³ que le faltÃ³ maldad. No sÃ©, Ã©l no me gustÃ³. Me gustÃ³ el arco de transformaciÃ³n de Lityerses, me gustÃ³ mucho. De verdad me hizo pensar sobre el Ãºltimo encuentro que tuve con Lit en The Lost Hero y ha cambiado y crecido mucho. Lo amo.
De resto, nada rescatable, solo Agamethus que me encanta por ser un fantasma sin cabeza y que usa una Magic 8 Ball para predecir el futuro.

REREAD REVIEW!
Forget everything i said about TDP the first time i read it. It's a masterpiece.
I don't delete my original review because i liked it even though i don't share this 2017-me-thoughts anymore.
ORIGINAL RATING: 3 stars
ORIGINAL REVIEW!
""As long as Gods shall live, so long shall I love you""
I'm going to handle percentages in this review because I feel mathematician af.
Ok, for start with, I must say I didn't like this book. I'm not sorry. But in 75% of the book NOTHING happened! Nothing happened.
I'm really disappointed in the result. The waiting and rereading of The Hidden Oracle (which I gave the 5 stars because it's perfect) I got much higher expectations of The Dark Prophecy, and here we are: I, giving 2/3 stars to another novel and you reading my hater reviews of books that in theory I should have loved.
Now I'll begin.
""You don't have to be a god. Just do your best to your friends""
Apollo: Honestly, Apollo already tired me. I love him and I feel immense gratitude to him for being my godly daddy but, I'm tired. This was him during the book: 25% denying his mortal condition and wanting to be a god again because being human sucks; 25% crying for his lost loves; 50% vomiting. That's him. Although I must say that these things make a real and credible character, but, enough. I think five books is a lot. I don't know, lately nothing surprises me.
Another thing, I LOVE LGBT+! I love them. But now, Rick, 80% of the population in his books is lgbt + community, and there are almost no heterosexuals in the Riorduniverse or whatever it's called. In TDP, there's Apollo, the gayest gay in gayland; (view spoiler).
""He jokes more when he's nervous. He also jokes worse when he's nervous""
(view spoiler)
""I can not give up, Apollo/Meg needs me""
Meg: I love Meg but now not that much. I don't know, she lost her essence. I love her and I hope she has a beautiful destiny like Persephone or something, I don't know, I don't even know what to expect from Rick. Nothing. Nothing at all.
(view spoiler)
Anyway, I love her and I love her ways of being and thinking.
""We only fail when we stop trying""
The plot: I didn't like the plot, nor the villain, nor any of that. Commodus promised, but then if only he wanted to dominate an entire city, it seemed to him that he need to be more evil. I don't know, I didn't liked him. I liked the transformation arc of Lityerses, I liked it a lot. It really made me think about the last encounter I had with Lit in The Lost Hero and he has changed and grown a lot. I love him.
But, nothing salvageable in the rest, only Agamethus that I love him for being a headless ghost that uses a Magic 8 Ball to predict the future.
(view spoiler)
""The longer you live, the weirder the world gets""
But anyway, it was a good read that I could finish faster but I'm really stupid and I have to go to classes. I'll see you again, Dad, in a couple of months. Thanks for everything, Apollo and Rick for saving me on school days thinking about ostriches with helmets. (less)",Negatif
,"Romance, Contemporary Romance",â’¶lleskelle - teamSÃ¸renâ™— âŠ²I like big b00ksâŠ³,"*Edited to add* I finished the book and completed my review.
â€œHow old are you?â€ â€œJe suis douze ans.â€
I don't think I have it in me to pick this one again.
""Mon moitiÃ©! Mon moitiÃ©""
It has been over a week and I'm still chuckling whenever I think about Diot, Lenoir and GeneviÃ¨ve desperatly crying out her love for her brother in this approximate French Google translation the author deemed ""okay"" to illustrate the historic part of her romance, turning their tragic and horrific story into something RIDICULE.
â€œArretez-vous.â€ Stop!â€ he commands.
â€œSortez-vous.â€ Leave! â€œMaintenant.â€Now!
â€œPourquoi?â€ Why? I ask, tears beginning to stream down my face. What has happened? Where is mon moitiÃ©?
Pains me to say but, as interesting the author's approach of a fateful love may be, the amount of errors and bad French in the book pulled me out of the story.
If used to give the characters authenticity and anchor furthermore the story in France during tragic events like it's the case here, it's regrettable but it defeats the purpose entirely to have your characters speak like toddlers.
â€œMonsieur Winslow, comment-allez vous?â€ the elder man greeted.
â€œÃ‡a va, merci. Et vous?â€
â€œTrÃ©s bien, merci. Madamoiselle Claudine est en la caravane.â€ He pointed to a trailer on the right. Thanking him again, Jesse took off in the direction of Claudineâ€™s trailer.
If you think it doesn't matter in the scheme of the whole story, good for you, I'm glad some of you could enjoy the book for what it is. If you don't have notions of French it shouldn't bother you the least.
As for me, I'm merely reviewing what I was given to review. The author built a supposedly epic love story with the notion that love trumps it all, even time and based her tale on tragic historical facts.
I'm really sorry to say that given the unrealistic start I've read, it failed to keep me interested and most definitely hindered my ability to care for these characters and to consider the story seriously.
â€œJe suis Ã  Paris.â€ Her diction was perfect and authentic, no trace of a New Jersey accent in her now sweet, child-like voice.
Was it, really? Perfect and authentic?
How hard is it to find a couple proof readers for a few lines of French in a book? Pretty hard it seems judging by the translations in this book.
Better suggestion yet, authors : If you don't speak that language but can't be bothered to have it proof-checked, maybe you should refrain to use it altogether, especially if all it offers is disservice instead of that je-ne-sais-quoi you were looking for.
Very disappointing.
Bien Ã  vous, une lectrice FranÃ§aise.
*Edited to add*
Curiosity got to me and I ended skimming over the rest of the storyâ€”yes, skimming, since very little was holding my interest at this stageâ€” a couple days ago.
Verdict? I'm glad I was repelled by the bad translations early in the book.
Would I've enjoyed the book more without the French translation incident? I doubt it and honestly it's entirely possible it colored my judgment regarding the rest of the story.
My impression about what made me grab this book, the romance and the original idea that love trumps it all, remains the same. I really love the idea of the premise, alas the execution and character's development of our present time heroes left me unmoved.
The heroine, Kylie, sounded too juvenile for me to be able to connect with her. The hero was your typical bad boy rockstar... A jerk with everyone but Kylie. But a jerk nonetheless. At less in my eyes.
I was left unfazed by the romance and their supposedly ""connection"" and completely turned off by their attempt at phone sex. Which happens out of the blue, nor Kylie or Jesse have declared any intentions toward each other yet, they haven't even kissed, yet the hero asks her to send him a pic of her pussy because he misses her. REALLY?
â€œOkay spread your legs, and with your phone, take a picture of your pussy for me.â€
Of course she agrees and readily sends her best shot :
â€œOkay here it comes. I hope it's photogenic. It would be really embarrassing to have non-photogenic pussy.â€
It sounded so out of character for them, I'm all for attraction, love, lust, making you act out of your comfort zone, but it did read like a parody of phone sex.
â€œI'm really, really wet. Here, I'm going to put the phone DOWN THERE so you can hear itâ€ She puts the phone between her legs for a few moments, knowing it would kill him.â€œCan you hear how wet I am?â€
The hero ended streaming words after words for the sake of appearing naughty and in charge, all I could picture was a bad porn flick...
â€œKeep stroking your pussy. Oh God, I can't wait to be buried in you. I want to pull you down on my cock and you ride me. Ram you down onto me so that I'm deep inside you. It's going to be my pussy Kylie. And you're going to give me my pussy. Give me my pussy.â€
Also I almost bailed again after the ""photogenic pussy"" line but this attempt at dirty talk just made me a quitter. Don't hold it against me!
Regarding the ending... I was expecting it, if you look at the story and keep in mind that those two lovers keep finding each other through time it makes sense that their story would repeat itself present time.

She becomes acquainted with an attractive man, Hansu, from the village and meets him in a secluded area. He is smitten with Sunja. It is now that Sunja's stone in the mosaic will take a curved turn. She becomes pregnant and the married Hansu cannot take this relationship further. A benevolent minister, suffering from tuberculosis, offers to marry Sunja, but in doing so, the couple must move to Japan for his ministry. This stone is cast farther into the unknown.
Sunja and Yangjin will live with his brother and sister-in-law in a tiny house in the part of the village designated for Koreans. And here the mosaic takes on a darker hue. The Japanese treat the Koreans as ""unclean"" and they are ridiculed throughout this time period as the Japanese eventually inhabit Korea itself. As war threatens, food and a sense of livelihood becomes scarce. Yangjin and his fellow ministers are arrested and taken to prison by the Japanese for not bowing to the image of the emperor. His brother must take care of the family now. The mosaics flow tragically in a downward spiral.
Throughout Pachinko we will experience individuals desperately making decisions that will affect this family profoundly. Jealousies, passions, dark secrets, and hatred will visit upon them. The internal cog of this wheel results in painful instability in this family while the outer rim is bent by conditions outside their realm. History and its aftermath can be a cruel master.
What struck me the most is the single thread of loss of identity as two countries inhabit what was once separate domains. It becomes the oppressed and the oppressor. The Japanese culture overshadows all that is Korean in language, religion, and certainly in social status. Later, Korea finds itself in a dust storm eventually by the Russians and even the Americans as events unfold.
Pachinko, a lengthy undertaking, is filled with an undying spirit in which we all can relate to no matter where the beginning of your mosaic takes place........the supreme sacrifices and love of those who came before us as you stand blessed in the light of that reality.

,"Nonfiction, Self Help, Psychology, Autobiography, Memoir, Business, Audiobook",Teri,"This is a short book on handling grief, or as the author calls it ""Option B"". That's the plan you have to go with when life takes you off course and on a new path. Sheryl Sandberg is an executive at Facebook and was on a vacation in Mexico with her husband Dave, and their friends. Dave died on that trip while working out at the resort gym. It was completely unexpected. This started Sheryl and her two children on their path down Option B. This book covers the uncomfortable situations that she often found herself in after his death, learning to be strong for her kids but vulnerable enough to let them know it's okay to grieve. Sheryl also talks about becoming resilient and eventually moving on and finding happiness in life.
This is a great book for those who are grieving but also for those who are supporting those who have had a major loss. In particular, I was inspired the chapter on dealing with the ""elephant in the room."" We are often not sure what to say to someone who has just suffered a loss. Sometimes, that person just wants to talk and reflect and that was the case for Sheryl. It relieves the tension and awkwardness. In the future, I'll remember to ask and to allow the griever to talk if they would like.
Many of the topics covered can be applied to other losses as well. Loss of jobs, homes, relationships, etc. There are different types of grief and our ability to deal with loss means we have to face it head on and adapt if we are going to find joy in our lives once again. (less)",Positif

â€œWeâ€™re all different combinations of crazy.â€
A book hangover, that is. It appears a handful of my friends read Rabbit Cake this past Spring, but GR must have been glitchy (or maybe I was sleep-scrolling then) because I donâ€™t remember hearing anything about it until just last week when my real-life friend (hard to believe, but yes I do have like two of them) said she thought it might be right up my alley. If youâ€™re reading this, let me say THANK YOU REGINA!
Meet the Babbitts . . . .
Things have been a little rough ever since Eva (the Babbitt wife and mother) died. Now, Elvis spends her time trying to figure out what really happened to her mother, Livvie is a potential danger to herself (and sometimes the entire family) every night when she sleep-eats and their Dad walks around wearing their momâ€™s robe and lipstick while caring for the new love of his life â€“ a parrot named Earnest whose voice sounds exactly like their dearly departed loved one. Rabbit Cake is a story about the grieving process, told by a family who is just . . . .
â€œtrying to be good.â€
Warning to all readers: If you plan on enjoying a slice of Rabbit Cake the first thing youâ€™re going to have to do is resign yourself to the fact that Elvis is a 10-year old trapped in a 147 year oldâ€™s body. Not literally, of course, but there has never been a human born who has the wisdom and insight and humor as our young heroine, here. If you can allow yourself to let go and enjoy and the ride, youâ€™ll find one of the most delightful dysfunctional families since the Bluths or Belchers.
Weâ€™re talking people who will make you laugh out loud . . . .
â€œHow is she doing?â€
â€œSheâ€™s dead.â€
â€œOh my God,â€ he said.
â€œThanks for the help.â€
And, as much as I hate admit, maybe look like this before youâ€™re finished . . . .
(SPOILER ALERT: (view spoiler))
As you come to the conclusion with the Babbitts that . . .
â€œDeath never makes sense, no matter how someone dies: murder, accident, old age, cancer, suicide, youâ€™re never ready to lose someone you love. I decided death will always feel unexplained; we will never be ready for it, and you just have to do the best you can with what you have left.â€
Rabbit Cake is going down as one of my favorites this year (which should serve as Exhibit A on why GR shouldn't push its users into sharing their 2017 wrap-ups so early) and this family is one I wonâ€™t ever forget. All the Stars.

,"Science Fiction, Mystery, Fiction, Dystopia, Apocalyptic",Jeffrey,"Carrie Vaughnâ€™s â€œBannerlessâ€ is a science fiction book of ideas. Ostensibly a mystery, this short novel is really an exploration of the ramifications of the effect of scarce resources on society. But unlike the summary on the cover of the book, the main character Enid, an â€œInvestigatorâ€ does not expose cracks in foundation of the society. What she does is enforce the laws of this community run society. Essentially, the Investigators are judge, jury and enforcer of the Coast Road rules. They travel from town to town to make sure the Coast Road polities are obeyed. The most stringently enforced rules deal with over-consumption. After the â€œFallâ€, the apocalyptic catastrophe that killed millions and decimated society two generations or so ago, the remaining people had to band together to make it.
Small communities sprung up and down the Coast Road, grew their own food, hunted or fished and made do with a small amount of technology that survived plus the books and treatises saved by the founders. Vaughn imagines that birth control would be one of the main technologies that would survive this catastrophe. The Coast Road society uses the ability to control birth and control population to ensure that the towns and households do not over consume scant resources. People are only allowed to have children (obtain a Banner) if the community or their household can show the ability to support more children. And people who get permission proudly display their banners.
Needless to say that if people try to illegally gain a child, the Investigators are quick to punish the household by either splitting them up or taking children away from their families and parents or punishing the community by banning children for a time. In Enidâ€™s mind these transgressions should be punished severely. Several times Vaughn depicts Enidâ€™s anger as an Investigator. Her fear of what happened before and her desire to not have it happen again.
The novel is split into two halves. Enid and Tomas, her co-Investigator, and mentor, have been called to Serenity, a small community down the Coast Road, where one of the citizens has died under suspicious circumstances. The only mystery is whether the man, who appears to be bannerless, that is born without permission of the Coast Road, and ostracized in Serenity fell or was pushed to his death. Although the â€œculpritâ€ is easily identified early on, it is Enidâ€™s investigation of the reasons for his death that is the key. Serenity is a town run by a counsel made up of Ariana, Philos and Lee, three heads of households in the town. Enidâ€™s discovers that Ariana requested the investigation, but has ulterior purposes. Philos, who runs the Bounty household, has run roughshod over the town for a while and Ariana wants to take him down. But while Enid pursues her investigation, she runs into Dak, a troubadour that she had journeyed with in her youth.
This is the second part of the novel. In a series of timeline shifts, Vaughn skips back and forth from the present to the past. Enid tells of the time before she was an Investigator and went down the Coast Road, visiting various towns and making love with Dak, a sweet playing musician. Enid journey is both a journey of discovery of who she is and who Dak is, but also a reinforcement in many ways of the benefits of the Coast Road society rules. Enid discovers that she wants to be useful and stand on her own merits, while Dak is a little hollow at his core, and Enid discovers does not want to get involved with Investigators or society. His wandering ways are as much a part of his reaction to what happened to him as a kid as Enid strong center are hers. Enid will also run into people in an abandoned pre-fall city, where a woman with three malnourished children is surviving in a nomadic existence. This is a woman who will not accept the population controls of the Coast Road and telling says to Enid, that the Coast Road ""takes your children away""
Enid and Tomas investigation of Serenity, Dak, Ariana and Philos will reveal the tensions in a society that values control of resources and rules against freedom to do what you will. In the end, greed and power are always a danger to societal rules.
The real question for the reader is whether Vaughn through Enid makes her point. Is the Coast Roadâ€™s society just. Can religiously controlling reproduction and resources ensure that a society can grow responsibly? The jury is out for this reader. But Enid is very convinced and diligently pursues punishment for the people who want to break her societyâ€™s rules.

,"Mystery, Thriller, Fiction, Amish, Suspense, Audiobook ",Thomas,"4 stars
Last year I won Among the Wicked, book 8 in the series, in a Goodreads giveaway. The publisher, Minotaur Books, sent me this book instead. I contacted them and asked if they would send me Among the Wicked. They apologized for the mistake and sent me Among the Wicked. They also said I did not have to worry about reading or reviewing Down a Dark Road.
This is book 9 in the series, and I recommend reading them in order, although I started with book 8 because of the giveaway. I have since read books 1 and 2 in the series. Kate Burkholder is the police chief in a fictional small Ohio town with a substantial Amish population.
The prologue sets the scene with the murder of an Amish woman.
Then the main part of the book opens with a lyrical description of the fictional Tuscarawas covered bridge in Painters Mill. I know it is fictional because my wife and I have visited 575 covered bridges with the help of her World Guide to Covered Bridges. This one is not listed in her WGCB. However, many of the cbs that we have visited are about 150 years old.
This book has Kate taken hostage by an escaped convicted murderer, Joseph King, who was her
first teenage crush. He insists that he is innocent. She agrees to look into his case. I won't go into spoiler territory, but it is an absorbing read.
Thanks again to Minotaur books. (less)",Positif
,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Magic, Paranormal, Witches",Scrill,"""Real education doesn't make your life easy. It complicates things and makes everything messy and disturbing. But the alternative, Elloren Gardner, is to live your life based on injustice and lies.""
Okay, so here's the deal. There are a plethora of long reviews (both bad & good) going over this book. So, I have decided to make this as to the point as possible. Before I start, let me just say one thing. I am incredibly glad that I read the book instead of heeding the reviews imploring people to stop supporting the writer & publisher.
The Story-Elloren Gardner comes a family that is descendant of a famous mage that essentially lead a revolution against the races that were controlling and killing their kind. She is now at the age where she can either be wandfasted (married) or go off to university. Her uncle is steadfast in having her wait to be wandfasted and has her go to university. Throughout the book she has to deal with the pleasures and ramifications of her genial history. The major conflict she must deal with is the prejudice that has been ingrained into her society against every other race.
The World Building-Laurie Forest did an amazing with the world building. She has taken quite a few of paranormal creatures and molded them into a new world rich with history, violence, and hatred. From elves, werewolves, mages, to some adapted creatures such as Kelts, Urisk, etc. I found it incredibly fascinating to find so many types of races and being who I am, I took a great interest in trying to find out where some origins came from. I question things like are the Kelts supposed to be Celtic? The Elves have several races within the race, such as a Smaragdalfar, a green scaled elf, is that rooted from smaragdnine which basically means emerald in color? Are Icarals rooted from the winged God Icarus? Forest did such a wonderful job integrating all these races and creating history for each of them. She really made it plausible as to why the Gardnerians are SO racist. From the history they are taught, to religious aspects, to even their toys, they are raised to hate everyone and put themselves on pedestals. The fact the Elloren changes at all is a miracle since every other race is pretty much super awful to her. Why would she want to be more accepting of them?
The Characters-This is the one place that I felt the book lacked, but it wasn't enough to dock even a half star for me. I mean, I adored Elloren for the most part, but really, is Lukas Grey really worth all the torment she's getting? I was really proud of reading her transform her opinions, even if it does take almost the entire book for her to drop most of her prejudices. But honestly, she's 18 years old and her environment is not exactly promoting the change, so lets give her the benefit of the doubt and appreciate the fact that she even does get past how she was raised. Also, could Fallon Bane be any more of Regina George?
I mean I was really expected a little bit more than teen drama when it came to boys...
Anyway, I loved the book, and I can't wait to read the next installment and see what other secrets we can discover about the world. (less)",Negatif

Cried, because after having waited for this final installment for an entire year [almost to the day!], it met and exceeded every single expectation I had for it!
Cried, because I was blown away, once again, by J.R. Ward's ability to tell a story in a way so few authors can: poetic and full of soul.
Cried, because I was overwhelmed by the amount of emotion the story sprung on me. As a reader, I can't help but always look for HEA type ending. In this case, we got multiples.
Cried, because this series coming to an end truly feels like the end of an era. They don't write sagas like this any more. So smart without being pretentious. So sexy without being vulgar. So decadent. So full of pride of the place you hail from.
Cried, because I know that I'll never be able to express properly everything I feel for this series.
This book was my most anticipated read of 2017 and it delivered in spades, as I knew it would. When it comes to J.R. Ward, quality is never in question. Even though the ending was bittersweet (because it was the ending, you see), it was glorious! I am looking forward to many, many rereads of the series that captured my heart.

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction, Literary Fiction",Trudie,"Well, this will certainly teach me about that old adage re books and covers. I really love a Victorian floral in the William Morris mode and buttercup yellow endpapers, charming !
In my mind this was going to be a gothic tale of serpents and maybe some Victorian sexual repression - something along those lines.
Certainly, serpents were mentioned, people seemed flustered about it but the entire thing lacked any kind of narrative tension or gothic edge, unless you count the odd fog.
Then there was the love quadrilateral, I really stopped counting how many people were in love with Cora, not by all accounts a great beauty or from what I could see particularly engaging. So this epidemic of lovelorn people seemed puzzling to me. Passions when they did very briefly arise were kind of neutered and odd. This is certainly not a Victorian romance novel then.
One could read it for passing social commentary on the dire state of housing in Bethnal Green or perhaps for an interesting account of medical procedures of the era. My point being this seemed like a novel struggling to figure out what it wanted to be. There was some very picturesque writing on landscapes and scents and sounds but this only takes a novel so far.
I somehow missed something in this book that resonated with other readers, perhaps one needed to fall in love with Cora as well.

,"Mystery, Fiction, Crime, Thriller, Mystery Thriller",Kristy,"THE LATE SHOW introduces us to a new character in the Connelly canon: Renee Ballard, a young female detective in the LAPD striving to prove herself. Ballard works the night shift, where she picks up evening cases. But Ballard hates that she never gets to see an investigation to fruition--always turning her cases over to the daytime detectives. So when she is assigned two late shift cases, the shooting of a young female in a nightclub and the horrible beating of a transsexual prostitute, she finagles a way to stay involved with both. This means still working the night shift while--mostly secretly--tracking down leads on her cases during the day. In doing so, Ballard gets caught up in department politics and a case that could lead her to immense danger.
Connelly is just an excellent writer; I love all his books, and I was excited and interested to hear he was creating a new character. I've been in love with his Detective Bosch for years. This novel is basically vintage Connelly with a modern twist, with Ballard being extremely knowledgeable about the night shift and police procedure. Connelly is still clearly up-to-date on the current workings of a police department. At times, you almost forget you're not reading about Bosch and his shenanigans.
But, in saying that, I feel as if I don't give Renee Ballard true justice. She's a wonderful character--a strong, yet damaged female, who is smart and fascinating. It's a pleasure to read about such a complicated individual. Ballard is on the late shift (aka the late show) because she accused a former supervisor of sexual harassment and was subsequently blackballed. Yet she's dedicated to her job, almost to the point of obsession. At times, I was amazed she could get away with some of the stuff she pulled. (Sound like any other Connelly characters we know?)
Nonetheless, Ballard pulls us into an incredibly compelling mystery. It started a tad slow for me, but quickly picks up and remains quite mesmerizing. The cases are well-plotted and exciting, and Connelly gives us peeks into Ballard's personal life, without revealing everything. The novel spends a lot of time focusing on her thoughts and feelings, but is still quite compelling.
Overall, I really enjoyed this one. I'm excited to see Connelly with a new character and look forward to more of Renee Ballard in the future.

,"Fiction, Historical, Historical Fiction",Elyse Walters,"THANK YOU *St. Martin's Press*!!!! A BIG TIME THANK YOU!!!! Had I not received their sweet email recommendation --- I may have missed this doozy-knock-out-smashing-whopper-pistol of a WONDERFUL novel!!!!
It's funny... I read most of this in bed -on my Kindle ebook - during the dark sleepy hours listening to the pouring rain outside my window, but I had never seen the book 'cover' until now. The cover perfectly captures the image of our leading lady. ""Lillian Boxfish"". Its exactly how I imagined her. Paul, my husband, says, ""that's going to be me at age 85"". I could only wish! (we do share a passion for walking). lol
I have such a soft spot for Lillian Boxfish and her storytelling, ha: THANK YOU, Kathleen Rooney! If I wrote all that I'd like to really say-- this review would be 10-20 pages long.
There are so many interesting and inspiring aspects about our main character,...that I find myself thinking about new possibilities in the ways I perceive myself and other people. Lillian was committed to living her life from truth, love, and joy. Her ""physically impeccable"" health-- in her 80's,-- in 1984, was a reflection of the way she lived!!!
Right from the start --this novel comes 'ALIVE'. Lillian sets the stage by sharing a memory from when she was 5 years old. (While reading this novel.....I went back to that beginning early memory - when she was still a child - before coming to New York and read it twice more). I could see her little mind in action --Lillian was not 'only' taking inspiration from two strong independent women who came before her: (Sadie who lead her to Manhattan.... and Phoebe who led her to poetry and advertising), it seemed to me...that Lillian was most happy when she didn't allow herself to be contaminated with other people's life agenda. Lillian was a woman who simply was committed to her own inner truth. There was a scene early in the book when she binged on a package of Oreo cookies. She noticed what she did... ( wasn't her most proud moment, but also not a big fricken deal either. I'm thinking... ""wow...what lesson can I take from this?"" I'm serious... ""what lesson can I take from this scene""? Hell... I could write a book! Haha!!!!
Short point is: I'm sure Lillian did not binge on sugar daily, but at the same time, other than go for a walk to burn off a few of those calories -- only because it was New Years Eve and she was going to dinner in a few hours....she didn't beat herself up about it. Nor did I ever get the feeling that this woman assigned 'false cause' reasons
about anything. She wasn't a women to sit around to bitch and blame others or herself.
I loved her philosophical ways of looking at life: ""things are the way they are"". Criminals and muggers in the city? So be it! Didn't stop Lillian from walking!
I LOVE HER! I love her I love her!!!
We learn much about Lillian: her job with R. H. Macy's as the highest paid female writer in the advertising dept., her marriage to Max, ( he divorced her), her children and grandchildren, her poetry, her clothes ( she likes to think that she does not dress like a typical old woman), her lunchtime poems, ( people didn't always hate pigeons in the city), the spirited people she meets in the city, and the many places Lillian takes us while walking around New York a city!
I hope they make a movie of this book -- HAM IT UP GOOD TOO!!!
Oh... when I told Paul that my new heroine, *Lillian Boxfish*, once bought 25 ""Helena Rubinstein Orange Fire lipsticks-- '25'.....BECAUSE she heard they were going to discontinue her favorite lipstick... Paul said, ""sounds just like something I would do"".
NOTE: I would not!!!! NOT LIPSTICK.....
But.... shhhhh, I did once buy 10 pair of Dr. Scholl's wooden sandals... when they were on a 'sell-out' sale. I, too, heard they were being discontinued. I've been wearing these shoes since I was about 10 years old. I still love them. I now have a lifetime supply. So... I say... ""enjoy your lifetime lipstick, Lillian Boxfish""!!!
Last....A WOMEN WHO WALKS..... is a woman after my own heart!!!! Walkers share a special love together -- in the same way readers do!
It's so damn REFRESHING to read a novel that inspires humanity!!
Totally enjoyable!!! Another years favorite!!!!!!
Thanks again, St. Martin's Press, Netgalley, and 'hats off' to Kathleen Rooney!!!!

,"Mystery, Fiction",Jean,"Anne Hillermanâ€™s story features tribal police officer Bernadette â€œBernieâ€ Manuelito, who is married to Sgt. Jim Chee. Her mentor is Joe Leaphorn who is recovering from a head injury. Bernie attends a Shiprock High School basketball game while she is off duty. A car is bombed in the parking lot and Bernie is the first on scene. The car belongs to Aza Palmer, an attorney who is the official mediator between the Native American tribes, the environmentalists and a corporation who wants to build a resort on Navajo land near the Grand Canyon. Chee and Manuelito must solve the crime.
The book is well written and researched. Anne Hillerman seems to be getting better with each book she writes. I enjoyed the information about the different tribal affiliates, language, and the conflict between the Navajo and Hopi. The author explains the various Navajo tribal myths and customs which to me makes the story far more interesting. I think most readers will have figured out who the perpetrator is before the end of the book. Somehow, that knowledge only increases the suspense to find out if you are correct and how will they be revealed in the story.
I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. The book is approximately ten hours long. Christina Delaine does a good job narrating the story. Delaine is a stage actress and voice over artist as well as an audiobook narrator.

,"Mystery, Fiction, Thriller, Mystery Thriller",Shorty,"This is a pretty good mystery novel, but it's so multi-layered that some readers may have a hard time keeping up with all the mysteries going on. And all the people. And all the places......lol.
The novel was just so jam-packed with happenings that it seemed to be more than one book, all together. It was still quite interesting, and held me listening throughout it. Though I am a little exhausted by everything that V. I. Warshawski had to go through....!
I enjoyed the audiobook very much, with Susan Ericksen as the narrator. She was able to keep most of the characters from sounding alike, and her accents (like those of Lotty Hershel and a French character) from sounding too ridiculous.
I'd give this audiobook a solid 3.5 stars, and recommend it to lovers of mystery novels, Warshawski novels, and the like. (less)",Positif

â€œThe single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.â€
This book was insightful, funny, i interesting and above all educating. I love Alan Alda! I loved him in Mash and his science interviews on television. I find him to be a smart and honest person. When i heard he wrote this book, i needed to read it, and I'm so happy i did.
Have you ever had a conversation with someone and found out towards the end that the two of you were not having the same conversation or misunderstood each other completely? I know i did. This book highlights those moments and helps you prepare for them.
â€œI walked over to the scientist, smiled confidentlyâ€”and immediately made three huge blunders. LISTENING WITH EYES, EARS, AND FEELINGSâ€
Alan Alda covers a whole range of topics, from listening, talking, really understanding what the other person is saying to how to get the other person to really understand you. He'll even teach you how to read minds. ;)
I liked how each chapter was explained with a personal story of his. It was funny, relatable and refreshing seeing someone else admit to making the same mistakes i have.
â€œResponsive Listening: In acting, this kind of relating is fundamental. You donâ€™t say your next line simply because itâ€™s in the script. You say it because the other person has behaved in a way that makes you say it. Relating to them allows them to have an effect on youâ€”to change you. Itâ€™s not just in acting that genuine relating has to take placeâ€”real conversation canâ€™t happen if listening is just my waiting for you to finish talking.â€
â€œjust listening to good communicators doesnâ€™t work. It takes training to learn how to do it. Iâ€™ve been listening to good pianists all my life and I still canâ€™t play the pianoâ€
There were a few scientific studies that i found irrelevant to the goal of the book. They seemed a little out of place in terms of interest related to the rest of the book, but i enjoyed it none the less.
I think i liked the chapter on Warren Buffett best. His insight on 'less is more' really works.
All in all, i liked it. Most of the topics mentioned were elementary, in the sense that i already knew them and felt the lengthy stories describing them seemed to dumb-down the book. But that was my only critic. (less)",Positif

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction",Bookdragon Sean,"I didnâ€™t want to write this review, Iâ€™ve been weighing it up for a few days, but this book is so far removed from the previous two books that a negative review is unavoidable. A Column of Fire is way too short and way too predictable, which is a sort of odd comment to make about a book over 750 pages long with a huge cast of characters. But let me explain.
Ken Follet is at his best when he writes massive historical yarns. He mixes the political and social issues of the age with the lives of some very real people, people who could have existed within the eras in which he writes. And he did that here, at least, in part. The Willards and The Fitzgeralds fortunes rose and fell with the Catholic and Protestant rivalry, which came to a climax when Elizabeth I took Englandâ€™s throne. Though I think this bookâ€™s greatest downfall is its sheer lack of depth and sense of crisis throughout.
I just didnâ€™t care about the citizens of Kingsbridge this time round.
Letâ€™s rewind and compare it to The Pillars of the Earth. After every major section of the novel, something big happened. The Kingsbridge market was attacked by William Hamleigh (twice) the church roof collapsed, Tom Builder had to abandon his child and Prior Phillip found himself at the Kingâ€™s mercy in France. The same sense of crisis was also apparent in The World Without End. With this book there was no real sense of danger for anyone (that I was made to feel for.) So it lacked the drama that made the previous two instalments so damn exciting.
I found myself not caring at all about most of these characters or their lives for that matter. I didnâ€™t know enough about them and when the story started moving they were never really built upon. Rollo Fitzgerald was awkwardly absent for large parts of the novel after initially being set up as a very important character. There were large transition periods between the charactersâ€™ lives that we seemed to miss and the story never fully came together as it needed to. Moreover, and most significantly, there was no sense of Kingsbridge community spirit. So that meant when danger did hit Kingsbridge, I yawned.
The romance was weak
Folletâ€™s books are always driven by romance, and this one was no different. But, again, this was a let-down. In this case the initial few chapters on it were perfectly fine; it was set-up as youâ€™d expect it to be. However, the aftermath was somewhat tepid. Where was the longing? Where was the heart wrenching emptiness when the lovers were separated? Sure, it was touched upon; though I think much more was needed to cement the mutual feelings. If this was Jack and Aliana or Merthin and Carris, then all parties concerned would have been beside themselves in agony. Ned and Margery seemed to suck it up and get on with their lives all too easily. And their ending was far too predictable at this stage. I needed so much more for this to work.
Do I think A Column of Fire could have been a good novel? Most certainly. It needed more editing. It needed to be padded out and certain sections expanded upon and revised. All in all, what I think A Column of Fire needed most of all was time, time to grow and become the story it ought to have been. I feel like Iâ€™ve just read an early draft of a potentially great novel, most dissapointing indeed. (less)",Negatif

,"Young Adult, Lgbt, Health, Contemporary ",Morris,"â€œ10 Things I Can See From Hereâ€ is one of the best books that I have read about anxiety disorder.
The way the story is written does an excellent job of showing the stream of consciousness that happens when something triggers anxiety. At times I was feeling the anxiety creeping in to my own head. The novel is by no means a one-trick pony, either. The issues of coming out, gay bashing, familial drug abuse, divorce, step-family dynamics, and first love are tackled head-on. All of the characters are developed, and for the most part, likable.
I canâ€™t stress this enough: My favorite part is that it did not follow the false trope of mental health issues being solved by meeting the right person. Salix helps Maeve, but she is not a miracle cure. Only Maeveâ€™s dad can kick his drug habit, no matter how hard his family tries to help. Good lessons, in my opinion.
I recommend â€œ10 Things I Can See From Hereâ€ for anyone looking for books about anxiety or a wonderful lgbt romance. Yay for diverse books!

It was the perfect conclusion to this extraordinary trilogy. The quality of writing in this book was so beautiful I highlighted something on almost every page. The dialogue was exquisite and the scenes were so vivid I felt I was there. I reread certain chapters over & over again as I wanted to keep reading the words.
I have always liked Ash and thought he was HAF in the first two books but my goodness Ash captured my heart in this book.

Gotta say if you don't admire and adore him after American King then you are bonkers.
ðŸ“š Heâ€™s watching me and Greer, and his face. His face. Iâ€™ve never wondered before what it would look like for someone to have their whole world in their eyes, never even thought to wonder.

This final book is a complex one with plenty of conflict and Sierra has provided a story that does justice to the love story of these three characters. Theirs is a complex love story, therefore this conclusion had to be complex. I knew it was never going to be an easy read and boy was I right. There were plenty of times I cried, like ugly snot cried, I gasped out loud at the plot twists and I threw my IPad on the bed in anger but because it's a Sierra Simone book I also swooned and needed a fan & new panties too.

,"Fantasy, Young Adult, New Adult",Maram,"I donâ€™t know where to begin with this review???
I mean I think iâ€™ve already mentioned everything I needed to say in my review of Nevernightâ€¦
Either way, to recap and reciprocate the points I mentioned in Nevernightâ€™s review, Godsgrave had even more witty banters. more blood. more pain. lots of angst. plentiful twists. the suspense could give you a clean kill, and even more traumatic than its prequel.
Tbh the moment I was done with this book, I almost gave into my weak mind telling me I was wrong to read this so early on especially because book 3 doesnâ€™t have a publication date yet, let alone a freakin title. If you think for one second to dive into this book without being aware that there is a major cliffhanger in the end, I wish you the best of luck! So please take your poor heart into consideration before jumping in, okay? ðŸ™‚
Remember how I previously mentioned that this book is even more gruesome than it's predecessor? Well, weâ€™re introduced to new characters in Godsgrave as this book continues where Nevernight left us off with. New characters aka more deaths, you get it ðŸ™‚ Thereâ€™s nothing different about the format used, we have the story told to us in past and present tense but this time itâ€™s spiced up a bit with the past tense being Mia post-Red Church and the present: 3 months post-Red Church. (view spoiler) Mia takes up a new task assigned by the Red Church and travels to Godsgrave to bid herself to become a slave of Leona (daughter of a shitty dude in the Senate, his name is irrelevant). There she meets other slaves and all of them have to fight with each other in a bunch of bloody contests (in public because hello, itâ€™s fun) set out by the Senate (she tried not to care about them but hahahah). The last one standing will be free from slavery foreveerrrrrrr. That said, her mind didnâ€™t drift from wanting to avenge her fatherâ€™s death so the closer she is to where she once belonged, the better she can get both jobs done. However, thereâ€™s a plot twist here and a plot twist there and a plot twist everywhere and as a requirement by sir Jay Kristoff, things just donâ€™t go as planned ðŸ™‚
I donâ€™t want to dive in to the characters as I feel itâ€™s best to go in blind but note that youâ€™re going to love them all, even if they suck. To conclude, this book is um great. itâ€™s um the best and um brace yourselves in the last 10% of the book because it could damage chunks of your brain cells in one go. Iâ€™m out ðŸ‘‹

The story is divided pretty equally between the Monkeewrench case and Magozzi and Gino's case but it becomes apparent that the two sides are going to blend into one at the end.

This books touches issues such as PTSD and it hit really close to home for me, i had to stop several times and just catch my breath. On the flip side it also teaches us a lesson, a lesson about taking each day as it comes and slowly learning to heal just as Hendy does.
I read this book in one day, albiet a few intervals but i just had to know how it ended, i was as much invested in the characters as i was the story and im so glad they got their HEA, Presley was exactly what Hendy needed and really brought him out of his shell and taught him to enjoy life again.

,"Lgbt, Young Adult, Contemporary, Romance",- Ì—Ì€ jess ÍÌ–-,"In my opinion, Our Own Private Universe is Robin Talley's best since Lies We Tell Ourselves. I'm really glad there's another book in the YA canon that discusses faith and sexuality, and I think Talley did a good job of incorporating modern day political issues into the plot.
I really liked Aki as a character. She was determined and intelligent and well-rounded. Her love of music and subsequent fallout from her quitting music played into the plot a bit less than I would have liked. At times I forgot that she was a musician. Otherwise, she was quite well-written. I'm sure there's criticism about a white woman writing a black character, and since I'm not black I do not feel comfortable going too into it, but it definitely shows when I think of books I've read from black authors. I really loved Aki's family as well - they were probably my favourite characters in the book (and Jake, who was ... a complete badass I love him). They were all so supportive of each other, and I love families that are like that. The family drama was probably the least dramatic in the book. Aki and Drew's dad is like, a really good dad. Wow. I really liked him. I liked the modern-day political climate presented in the book - it didn't go too dramatically conservative or too dramatically liberal, which I found to be pretty accurate.
As a bi person, I found the portrayal of bisexuality to be really accurate - I don't know if this is an ownvoices book, but I really related to a lot of what the bi characters talked about - struggling with identity, wondering how you like different genders. Even though it was a bit pedantic towards the end, I'm really grateful that there's discussion around bisexuality and what it's like to be bisexual, and how bisexuality differs from pansexuality, and how different identity can be for people. (A pan character! This might be the first pan character I've seen!) Our Own Private Universe succeeds in bi representation very well, and I'm pleased.
The romance wasn't the stand-out to me, which was a bit disappointing. I felt like Aki and Christa lacked the chemistry I wanted them to have. (view spoiler) But they do have a solid relationship by the end, and I'm happy that we're finally getting some nice f/f romances. (less)",Positif

I fell in love with the characters, with Tenley and Jonas but most of all with Birdie. She reached right through the pages and gripped my heart and gave it a good squeeze. One word sums up these charactersâ€”endearing.
I think most people who read my blog knows that I rarely read contemporary fiction. When I do, Rachel Hauckâ€™s books are the ones that I pick up. Yes, Iâ€™m a fan. Make no mistake though, this book is fantastic and Iâ€™m not saying that just because I enjoy this authorâ€™s work.
The interesting thing about The Writing Desk is the duel timeline. Most authors cannot pull off a duel timeline but Birdie and Tenleyâ€™s tales were so beautifully woven together. Their lives were connected in a way that left me reeling. Their connection was beautiful and I kept turning the pages to see where the story would take me.
Lastly, I want to say how much I appreciate this authorâ€™s authentic tale of loss, love and redemption. This book was bittersweet and the characters were flawed. They were realâ€”as real as a book character can be.
I hate to be on repeat but this book was just lovely and I truly think anyone that loves a sweet, clean romance would love this story. Itâ€™s not overly preachy and I think some devout Christians may want more. But, I like seeing the subtle hand of God working in the lives of those that need redemption. This book had the perfect amount of romance and faith elements for me. It felt authentic and not as if the author was trying to beat me over the head with a full plan of salvation. She let God find her characters where they were and I loved that. Truly, I loved this book.

She is ordered to bake twelve loaves of bread for the Nazi officers stationed in her French village every morning. She manages to make fourteen by mixing ground hay with the flour and distributes the two extra loaves to her village. Soon, she is managing a secret network and exchanging different goods. These acts of resistance help not just the villagers, its what sustains her.
I read a lot of historical fiction, particularly pertaining to this time period and this work did not stand out for me. There are numerous novels whose backgrounds are WWII and Nazi occupation and it is possible to write one that differs from the lot. This novel did not do that. The cover is lovely, the idea is great, the prose is nicely written but the execution is lacking. Emma is the central character. She is daring and stubborn but always finds a way to help out her village. While she might not come off as the most sympathetic person that is understandable given her current situation. The remaining characters appear to be chosen at random, they are not memorable nor do they add to the narrative. The plot does not really go anywhere, its stagnant.

Hot, hot, hot, this book is explosive. In Working It Devon and Riley take the reader back to their skyscraper of ridiculously hot men with a beautifully paced story of friends with benefits turning into something much stronger.
I loved book one but this one is even better as I found Hayden and Cody's relationship a bit less stressy and a lot more of a gentle slide into romance - with the added benefit of some incendiary sexy times. There's a lot of humour in this one too, the guys laugh a lot together and there's not as much angsty or dramatic moments.
Hayden was a nicely constructed character, I liked that he wasn't sure where his life was going and how he was trying to find a new one after breaking up with his ex.
Cody also could have been a one note character, fixated on his pained upbringing, but instead the authors made him an optimistic and encouraging friend to Hayden.
I loved reading their relationship grow slowly as they figured out that the friends with benefits option of their relationship wasn't enough anymore. Oh and the scene with Finn, make sure you've got a) a fan and b) a towel to hand when reading that one. Methinks that sailor boy needs his own story. It's not easy to write something generally considered ""porny"" without making it porn but in the hands of these two authors it felt perfectly placed and constructed within the narrative.
The epilogue was all ends up sweet as well. Now we wait for Derek's story and I'm intrigued as to see how Devon and Riley handle him and stop him from becoming too full on annoying.

,"Horror, Fiction, Science Fiction, Zombies, Dystopia, Apocalyptic, Post Apocalyptic",Andrew Smith,"I really enjoyed The Girl with All the Gifts, I thought it a well thought out and credible â€˜end of the worldâ€™ yarn. Moreover, it was written in such a way that (if you weren't already aware what it was) the true nature of the story crept up on the reader; at first I didn't know what was going on and by the time I discovered the hidden narrative I was completely hooked. And to add to this there were interesting characters whose fate I became invested in. It was also a novel that didn't leave you guessing at the end â€“ an explosive reveal made it absolutely clear how what the fate of any survivors was to play out.
So, this prequel novel was always going to face a number of, possibly insurmountable, problems: most significantly, the fact that the big story had already been told. And what, therefore, was left to tell? Well the author does a pretty good job of picking off some loose ends from the earlier tale and using these to knit together a further adventure. Yes, anybody who has read the first book (and you really do have to read â€˜Girlâ€™ first) will find few surprises here, but it does flesh out some background andâ€¦ and this is where I'm struggling, because I'm not sure it does much else.
The structure, in terms of the bookâ€™s cast, is actually quite similar. There's a young person (a boy this time, who is possibly somewhere on the autistic spectrum), a mother figure in the guise of a senior scientist and a bunch of soldiers/scientists who are largely dispensable and who are overseen by a conniving and bullying leader. In consequence, the tale starts to have a very similar feel to the first book â€“ but unfortunately without the surprises. In truth I drifted through much of it, barely engaged.
However, I don't want to be too down on it because I did appreciate the additional insight I got from reading this background piece and there is one surprise stored up in the form of an epilogue to the tale. In summary, it's ok - but not a patch on the first book. (less)",Netral

,"Fiction, Contemporary, Literary Fiction, Cultural, China",Angela M,"Imagine you're a 17 year old girl named Peilan who becomes Polly, and you've come come to the US from China seeking a better life . And oh by the way you're pregnant and here illegally, owing a loan shark $50,000. You have to work long hours in awful working conditions to scrape enough for the payments. You have to bring your infant son to work with you because there is no one to care for him. There are some things that happen in this story that were hard to relate to but then this immigrant experience is so far removed from what I know. This story was an eye opener for sure.
Imagine you are a young man named Daniel who was born in Chinatown in Manhattan, sent when he was one year old to live with his grandfather in a village in China and then sent back to his mother at six. That was when he was Deming before his mother disappears when he is eleven. It's been ten years since Peilan has disappeared and Deming is a college student struggling with being abandoned even though adopted. He struggles with his identity, with a gambling addiction, what to do with his life . He remembers when he was with his mother and doesn't understand why she left. At least he has his music. While I'm not a fan of hard rock, it is comforting to know that Deming's music is something he can hold on to . "" He would learn how to create music, matching tones to shades to feelings and translating them back to melody. ...He'd craft songs that conveyed exactly what he wanted to say....the rest of the world heard only sound, and that would leave him with lingering sadness..."".
The story is told from their two points points of view, a third person narrative from Deming's perspective and then a first person narrative by his mother. The common thread is their love for each other and their memories of each other. This is a sad story in many ways depicting the separation of a mother and child. It isn't until later in the story that we learn what happened to Peilan. I not going to say much more about the plot. Suffice it to say, this is a moving view of immigrants, a timely one. Lisa Ko does a good job of helping us imagine these lives. A striking debut, recognized by Barbara Kingsolver as the winner of the 2016 PEN/Bellwether Prize for fiction as a novel that addresses social injustice.

,"Romance, Contemporary, Contemporary Romance, Novella",Ana Paula,"This is a spinoff of the Fusion series written by the great Kristen Proby.
Kristen Proby is an author that can create strong female characters with a lot of spunk.
The Fusion series is about five girlfriends that own a hot restaurant in Portland called Seduction, they are partners and best friends.
In Blush for Me, we meet Kat Meyers and ""Mac"" MacKenzie (by the way this book is great!) and now Kristen has written a novella about Chase MacKenzie - Mac's brother.
The MacKenzie brothers own a wine tour company and are very successful in Portland. Chase is a A self-proclaimed life-long bachelor, and unapologetic about his distaste for monogamy. Maura Jenkins does not want to get marry or any strings attached. She is free and apologetically content with her life.
However, after meeting Chase their connection is too strong and maybe they have met their match for life.
This is a novella, but their journey is so alive and entertaining (also very hot and sexy) that we long for more words of this mature adult couple.
If you have not read other Fusion series, this is a standalone. But you will want to read the others since Kristen Proby has a way of writing romance that will engage you.

,"Fantasy, Childrens, Middle Grade, Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction, Young Adult",Nikki,"The Glass Town Game feels a little like Fairyland-lite. Based on the childhood games and stories of the Brontes, including Branwell, Valente delivers another kind of portal fantasy in which the Brontes find themselves in the middle of their own imagined world. The four are generally fun to follow, though Branwell is rather annoying (probably quite in line with the real Branwell). Itâ€™s all very whimsical and charming, but the Fairyland books are better at that, so it didnâ€™t quite work for me; Iâ€™ve seen Valente do it better.
That aside, itâ€™s an absorbing read, with so much cleverness, including sly references to the Brontes adult work and little pieces from their biographies, etc. It ticks along at a fine pace, and each of the siblings gets the eye of the narrator on them in turn, dissecting their faults and flaws and cheering for their strengths and cleverness. You canâ€™t quite root for Branwell (though you can understand him), but Charlotte in particular makes an excellent heroine. The first half is a little slower, and might take some getting into, but after the halfway point it picks up pace a lot.
If I were recommending somewhere to start with Valenteâ€™s work, it wouldnâ€™t be this, but itâ€™s definitely entertaining and beautifully written. Itâ€™s more in line with the Fairyland books in terms of style than her adult novels; it doesnâ€™t come across as more poetry than prose, if thatâ€™s something which bothers you about her books like Deathless and Palimpsest.

This book blew me away, right from the start. This is a book that held me captive, made me hibernate until the end. You need me, sorry I'm over here hiding under a blanket so no one can find me.....
I had to find out how it ended. Had to know it ended well. Needed to know my heart was whole. And let me tell you, I am in love with an actor, a dad, a boyfriend, an alcoholic, but above all else, I am in love with the man that loves his queen. Jonathan Cunningham didn't have the ideal childhood. Went to a private boarding school where he found the love of his life. Until he hit it big acting in Hollywood. Then his life became acting, drugs, alcohol, partying, you name it. He gave up EVERYTHING for this life, including his love of a girl that would do anything and everything for him. He even walked away from his baby. This right here could have stopped the book for me, however the writing, the way the story is told in alternating POV and flashbacks to previous years captivated me. This book completely owned me. The writing flawless
I loved the heroine in this book. I didn't blame her hesitation to not give in, to hand over her heart again. I totally get it. She's been shattered, she's been cast aside, she was left to build a life for herself, for her child, all alone without the help of the father and the man she loved while he partied in all ways possible. She was left to see constant tabloids of his life, his love life of all things. What she didn't know, what she didn't realize was his shame. His hurt. His desire. His undying love he held for her.
The chemistry, the sparks, the love that these two shared and is still sizzling between them, is it enough to forgive and is it enough to forget and move forward? And don't forget the beautiful love of an absolutely amazing child. This is a book I recommend hands down. I'll say it again, I loved this book, a new favoriteðŸ’—â¤ï¸ðŸ’—

,"Romance, Contemporary, Contemporary Romance, New Adult",Tijuana *Book Twins Reviews*,"Iâ€™m not sure I can tell you how much I loved this book, but Iâ€™m going to try. Letâ€™s start with the emotional aspect of the story. Sarah and Henry have been through some seriously tragic situations in their short lives. They both strive to be better people despite those issues. I loved getting inside Henryâ€™s head to understand better why he seemed like such a hot mess in book one. Donâ€™t fear, the character development is extraordinary. Henry more than changes the readerâ€™s perception in this book.
Up next is Nicholas. Although he doesnâ€™t feature prominently in this book, he set me off on my first crying jag. OMG, he is sweetness and love! The love and faith he has in his brother is immense and incomparable. I loved him before, but flove him now.
Next up, Pen and Sarah. These two sisters couldnâ€™t be more different. Theyâ€™re so much like my sister and I. Iâ€™m tall, sheâ€™s short. She loud, Iâ€™m not. I could go on and on. Itâ€™s the same with these sisters. Despite all their differences, they love and support each other. When the chips are down they know they can count on each other. Totally loved that! They shared a super sweet moment that sent me off on another crying jag. LOL
And last, but not least Sarah. Sarah is sweet, shy, quirky, and a total book nerd. I only share one of those qualities, but I connected with her character immediately. I knew her story would be interesting, but didnâ€™t consider how much it would affect me. Once her secret is revealed guess what I did. Yep, cried again!
Okay, now that weâ€™re done with that I have to say I wasnâ€™t a sobbing crying mess throughout this book. Itâ€™s a super fun and sexy read. I just wanted to highlight the emotional aspect of the story beforehand. Henry is hilarious, flirty, sexy, totally inappropriate at time, but BBF perfection. He and Sarah are super cute together.
Hereâ€™s what I absolutely loved: This book finally gave me an excuse to totally perv out on Joseph Morgan. I kept picturing him while reading Henry. Hereâ€™s some of my inspiration. Youâ€™re welcome!
'""Speechless, love? Was it something I said?"" His hands slide up my skirt, grasping my panties and skimming them off my hips and down my legs.'
'""That's good, so good, love.""'
'""That's it, love. That's it.""'
So to sum up, Royally Matched has it all! It is a well-rounded royally perfect romance! Buy or borrow this book as soon as possible, you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend it.

""That magnificent beast was a sub. An alpha-sub, assuredly""
""He was colossal. A mighty beast. A magnificent beast. Exquisite.""
This book tells the story of a male sub, an alpha sub and his dominatrix. I must say I have never read anything like this before so it was a bit of an experience reading a BDSM book that didnâ€™t have a female sub. It definitely took me a few chapters to get the story however I was soon hooked.
""He watched her approach not like he was taking the risky liberty he was taking but like it was his God-given right""

""It's like he was made for you.""
Mistress AmÃ©lie (Leigh) and Olivier (Olly) first meet at the Honey club where they start their sexual journey together. Straight away we are thrown into a seriously hot sex scene. The story continues to follow them and their sexual adventures with ups and downs they overcome along the way. The sexual tension between the two keeps you continuously captivated. This book has kink, a lot of kink. If you think of the things that might happen to a male sub at a BDSM club then you are spot on. If that isn't your cup of tea this book wont be for you at all.
""The beauty of play was earning the treasure of that trust and the honor of holding it precious.""
The majority of this book is about the d/s relationship between Mistress AmÃ©lie and Olivier built together which although was hot by the end I wish we got to see a bit more of their life outside of the Domme & Alpha Sub to take that connection that much further.
Overall I did really enjoy this book, it took me well out of my comfort zone but this book was HOT, KINKY, SEXY AND UNDENIABLY FILTHY. I would recommend going into this book with an open mind and be prepared blown away.

,"Nonfiction, Feminism, Writing, Essays, Politics, Womens",Sarah,"I loved Men Explain Things to Me when I read it a few years ago (I believe it was my introduction to Solnitâ€™s writing, and also one of the first essay collections I read) and expected to love this collection equally, but a few things stopped that from happening.
The collection got off to a great start with The Mother of All Questions and A Short History of Silence, and I also thought A Short Happy Recent History of the Rape Joke and Men Explain Lolita to Me were strong too. The rest of the essays were not bad as such, but I felt that they were a little dated (I think they were mostly written in 2014 or 2015), many covered the same ground to the extent where it got kind of repetitive (#yesallwomen was mentioned a LOT) and at times Solnit ended up going around in circles trying not to offend or make generalisations about â€œall menâ€.
I guess it could be said that my finding some of these essays dated or no longer entirely relevant could be prescribed to the fact that a lot has happened in terms of feminism online since the bulk of these essays were written, and that given the nature of the discourse in the 21st century it is hard for anything to stay current for long. Maybe that is the case, and if you donâ€™t keep up with these kinds of things maybe there will be a lot of food for thought for you in this collection of essays. However for me, I found that a lot of them retread familiar ground and didnâ€™t have anything particularly different or new to add to the discourse.

I nodded in an effort to convince myself it would be easy, a piece of cake, and yet still, I had that distinct, unsettling, dreadful feeling that despite our best efforts to make this work, the world was going to tear Trev and I apart.
Iâ€™m absolutely in love with L.H. Coswayâ€™s writing! Her characters are always so unique and vibrant. Iâ€™ve only read a few of the books in this series but I can tell you that there hasnâ€™t been one Heroine or Hero that I didnâ€™t love. The Heroines have had a rough start in life and somehow have been left alone to face all of lifeâ€™s challenges, but they persevere. Each Cross brother is charismatic in their own way and will steal your heart! Get ready to be dazzled by Trev and Reyaâ€™s love story!!
Trevor and Reya have been the best of friends since the day that they met. Although, Reya was a little more than disappointed that things never went any further as she was smitten with Trev from the moment she first laid eyes on him. Little did she know that Trev was harboring a crush on her as well. Reya is a singer/songwriter and Trev would show up to all of her performances. Whenever she spotted him in the audience she sensed something in his eyes that had her heart racing! One night Trev asks Reya to go out on an adventure with him â€“ that they should do things theyâ€™ve never done before. On this night, feelings that the two bottled up for so long come to the surface and they share a passionate night together. Reya was hesitant to cross the line between friends and lovers with Trev because she feared she would end up with a broken heart which is what happened when Trev gets the role of a lifetime on a reality TV show. The show becomes a huge hit making Trev an overnight celebrity and Reya decides to break things off so that she isnâ€™t holding him back from living his new and exciting life.
Fast forward to about two years later, present day, Trevor is back home for a visit and heâ€™s looking to have Reya back in his life. They havenâ€™t seen each other for nearly two years. While things have changed drastically for Trev, Reyaâ€™s been stuck in a holding pattern. Her feelings for Trev never truly dissipated but she tries as hard as she can to remain a bit aloof whenever heâ€™s around. Reyaâ€™s plans to avoid Trev are thwarted when he helps her get a temporary job as the PA for his show. For three weeks she will be traveling across Europe with Trev and his fellow cast mates.
Throughout the story, we are taken from the past to present so we get to experience all of the butterflies when their relationship is just starting and then the heartbreak when it all falls apart. But their love for each other transcends time and distance, and even Trevâ€™s behavioral disorder, ADHD. It is what caused him at times to be unavailable when Reya needed him the most. During their separation, Trev was going to counseling to learn how to manage his ADHD. He wants another chance with Reya and will go to great lengths to make that happen.
Trev is not the only one with issues in the relationship. Reyaâ€™s family chose to abandon her when she went through a traumatic experience and they all accused her of being a liar. She feels as though sheâ€™s never been anyoneâ€™s first priority and expects that the people closest to her will inevitably let her down, and when Trev isnâ€™t there for her during a couple of rough patches it only convinces her that sheâ€™ll never come first in his life either. Reya let her insecurities rule her which led her to push away the one person who truly loved her the most, but working on the show with Trev might just give them their second chance at happiness.
Get ready to fall in love with the latest couple in the HEARTS series! HEARTS ON AIR is currently available and those of you who enjoy the friends-to-lovers/second chance romance tropes will definitely want to check this one out!

,"Lgbt, Young Adult, Contemporary, Romance",alexandra,"DNF at 30% // i was really excited to read this â€“ a f/f contemporary ft a Japanese MC with a Mexican love interest?! yes pls. but.... i couldn't even get halfway. here are some thoughts:
(1) this main character is so. annoying. she's extremely stubborn and close-minded and refuses to see things around her. Sana is constantly arguing with her mother and it feels like she refuses to see things from her perspective. of course, her mom is very traditional Japanese and didn't grow up in America, so OBVIOUSLY, they won't agree on everything. but Sana seems shocked and annoyed that her mom isn't like ""other moms"" aka white moms. it's frustrating and heartbreaking. i feel like the same goes for her relationships with her friends.
(2) all the characters were cardboard cutouts of every stereotype ever â€“ except Jamie, the love interest, who's ""different."" at Sana's new school she immediately becomes friends with a group of Asian girls who look down on the other cliques: the goths (which are over exaggerated), the Mexicans (she actually groups them like that), the cheerleaders, and so on. the school setting felt like exactly High School Musical. everyone around the two leads are telling them to ""stick to the status quo,"" but it's SO unrealistic.
(3) the somewhat rascist remarks are really offensive. i think they're meant to be; they're rascist. but the way it was portrayed just made it seem artificial. i know people always make rascist comments and assumptions (i'm a POC myself), but this was a little too painful to watch. i think the author was trying to make a point on the rascism POC face, but instead it just made is feel clique-y and stereotypical. however painful, i think it was really necessary. i didn't enjoy hearing it but it needed to be said. (it's just the way it was shown... ugh i dunno)
(4) the romance itself is so cringey. i was excited when i heard this was going to be a f/f novel, but it's mostly Sana being extremely stalkerish and awkward. she immediately falls in love on first sight and tries to impress her in painful ways. Jame (the love interest), on the hand, seems unreadable. i can never tell if she actually likes Sana â€“ as a friend or something more.
i wanted to enjoy It's Not Like It's a Secret, but it really really fell short. i can't tell if it's because i listened to the audiobook and i was trying out audiobooks or of it's actually disappointing. either way, i don't think i'll be continuing. (less)",Negatif

I've followed the Phoenix Pack stories since the very beginning and yes I read 'that ' book (Feral Sins)with its now apparently deleted scene . It's always been apparent how closely entwined this Pack is and I loved that they accepted new members who are not fellow Wolves which leads me nicely to Riley. Riley is a Raven shifter who we first met protecting orphaned shifter children in the shelter. When they needed somewhere to live the Phoenix Alphas didn't hesitate and now Riley along with Dexter and Savannah have somewhere to call home. Well it should be perfect except Enforcer Tao has been anything but welcoming ! So imagine my surprise when this book started with well what I'm tempted to describe as a 'bang'! Oh yes the author throws this couple straight into a sticky situation which just gets worse when Riley's past catches up to her!
I'm loving that this author is exploring the possibility of different species of Shifters. We've had Margays , vipers, cheetahs and now we are introduced to a flock of Ravens. What's even more amusing is the fact that just like the Phoenix Pack the Ravens too have a resident bitchy character but rest assured no one outdoes the vitriolic Greta! Although the Ravens to my mind just didn't feel quite as involved with each other as the protective Wolves do although as a non predatory species perhaps that's why.
This book is firmly about Tao and Riley opening up and accepting each other . I won't lie Tao admits freely that he's an asshole ( his words not mine ) and he is very dominant and tries so hard to get Riley to drop her defences and let him in. They are so different and seeing them come together felt right. Raven has immense sadness in her past and still struggles to cope with grief so definitely prefers to keep others at arms length. There are a couple of subplots going on throughout this story which brings danger to the Packs front door and keeps the reader guessing right up until the end. However for me it's the characters, their dynamics and of course the cute Cubs that kept me reading. So a hot and spicy romance with lots of snark plus cuteness overload as young predators show their fangs and claws and it leaves this reader very happy indeed. Proof indeed that opposites do attract!

Welcome to hell
Harry Bosch soon finds out exactly what that cryptic warning means as one of two cases heâ€™s working on gets more complicated and dangerous than anything heâ€™s ever been involved in before. Heâ€™s supposed to be working cold cases as a volunteer for the San Fernando Police Department, same as he has been for the past two years after retiring from the Los Angeles Police Department under less than optimal circumstances. But now, Harry finds himself in the middle of a hot case in which a father and son have been brutally murdered while tending to their family owned pharmacy in San Fernando. Harry lets others in his unit take the lead in the case while tutoring them with expert advice from the sidelines as he has his hands full with another case that has resurfaced from his past, one that could threaten not only his livelihood, but his legacy built on integrity. With much help from his half brother, defense attorney Mickey Haller, Harry goes to war, not only to keep a killer where he belongs, but to defend himself and the truth, despite evidence to the contrary. But the other case pulls him in when he learns something critical about one of the victims. And soon, heâ€™s all over it and all the way in, way more in than he ever wanted to be.
Itâ€™s getting harder and harder to review Connellyâ€™s books each year when Iâ€™m running out of superlatives to praise them. So at the risk of repeating myself, Iâ€™ll simply say this is one of his best books yet featuring Harry Bosch, with a generous part in the story for his half brother, Mickey Haller. What a duo they make with their differing philosophies on work and life in general. Their interactions were definitely a highlight. Also, the intricate cases in this book did not disappoint since itâ€™s never just about catching the bad guys. Itâ€™s about unraveling the evidence to pursue the truth wherever it may lead.
There were two kinds of truth in this world. The truth that was the unalterable bedrock of oneâ€™s life and mission. And the other, malleable truth of politicians, charlatans, corrupt lawyers, and their clients, bent and molded to serve whatever purpose was at hand.
If youâ€™ve read any of this series, youâ€™ll know which truth Harry believes in. And in this book, it leads him to examine some painful truths about himself when reflecting on his turbulent childhood and the mother he barely knew. It added to that ever-present melancholy tone to the series that goes beyond the jazz music Harry favors to become the soundtrack of his life. A must read. (less)",Positif

HOWEVER.
Beginning with Broken Dove, and Deacon, and then The Promise, I became...less than enthused.
And then there was Wild and Free.
And my head exploded.
To be frank: I have talked a LOT of shit about some of KA's more recent releases.
I have been brutal in several reviews - no seriously - BRUTAL.
Don't believe me? I'll link some of those reviews at the end of this bad boy.
And I have been called a fair-weather friend for those reviews.
A fake fan for some of those reviews.
A drama seeking whore who only read those books to write rants for those reviews.
And you know what?
I scoff at that.
Because I am one of her biggest fans.
BIGGEST.
I have read over 52 of her books, people.
FIFTY-TWO.
And as true FANS, we are allowed to be passionate and critical of stuff we don't like from authors we love.
People don't read and buy 52 things they know they are going to dislike.
That's just bad math.
Most fans (funds and space allowing, of course) get everything they can get their hands on from whatever their fandom is.
Just look at EVERY fucking booktubers ""Harry Potter Shelf,"" for fucks sake.
They literally must have asked mom and dad for every edition, version, companion book, wand, what have you, for every Christmas and birthday since they were ten years old.
And I dig it. We all like to surround ourselves with stuff we love.
So it brings me total fucking JOY to have loved this thing.
I truly enjoyed every minute of it.
Yes, it got a little long-winded at times.
Yes, the second half was kind of without any of the major climactic moments I was expecting.
But, you know what?
Reading this made me feel like I was back in 2011 reading Motorcycle Man, which was my first KA ever.
Did I love it as much as Motorcycle?
No.
Is it one of the best KA's I've ever read?
No.
Probably won't be for you either.
But that's ok.
Because I just enjoyed it.
Reading this was like wrapping a familiar warm blanket around my shoulders and saying, Ahhhh....
I really liked Johnny.
He was swoony and KA-sexy.
And I really, really liked Eliza.
Yes, she was a hippie-ish, cooking, decorating, CUTE dress-wearing KA heroine, as per usual.
But, she was also PRACTICAL.
She wasn't an idiot.
She wasn't delusional.
She wasn't Justice, the retarded ""poet's soul"" from Bounty whom I wanted to tag with a mack truck.
But, most of all?
SHE ONLY CALLED JOHNNY ""HONEY"" FIVE TIMES.
Also worth noting is that KA changed up some stuff.
She didn't have people chin-lifting, saying ""eyes"" and constantly wax poetic about how ""cute"" everything was. She also didn't go into detail about drywall and slowly kill the parentheses button.
All of which I loved and appreciated.
So, #WINNING.
TL;DR: Looking forward to re-reading this one (as I re-read ALL of my 3+ star KA's) over and over and over...

,"Mystery, Fiction, Thriller, Mystery Thriller, Suspense",Roman Clodia,"If you've read Ware's In a Dark, Dark Wood, then you'll recognise that the essence of the plot here is exactly the same: a group of girls were once close friends, something horrible happened, they went their separate ways and are brought back together again 17 years later; the horrible thing resurfaces, the truth is uncovered. Once again, too, we're in an unusual location, here a dilapidated mill which is sinking under the encroachment of water. What this book lacks, though, that the first one did so well, is characters with individual voices and a sense of humour. With those qualities lacking, this turns into a generic melodrama that lacks credibility.
This supposedly tight-knit group turn out to have known each other for less than a year (they're 15 when they meet, haven't turned 16 when the horrible thing happens and they're separated, and despite not having seen each other for 17 years, when one of them texts the others they instantly drop London jobs, family, life to meet up - heck, my friends can't even co-ordinate drinks in the pub without military-style planning!
Add to that a boring narrator obsessed with how many times a day she has to breast-feed her screaming baby (surely important in real life, duller than dull to read about), characters who are thin stereotypes (the artistic one, the Muslim one, the anorexic one), a plot involving sinister locals and a desperate last-minute 'twist'.
It's a shame as Ware writes more fluently than many commercial authors in this genre but it seems that here she's just re-writing her first success without the elements which made it work: 2.5 stars for a fast, commute read which I was glad to finish.

,"Nonfiction, History, Politics, Philosophy, Writing, Essays",Steve,"Something short (but not sweet).
Something easy to read (but difficult to stomach).
Something worth reading (but not because you'll enjoy reading it).
Something scary - in that it could keep you up all night (except that, if you've already decided to read it, you're already up most nights after these long days).
Something important, arguably written for a target audience (most of whom will not read it).
Something that only a serious intellectual could distill - so eloquently - into bite-sized form for the masses who wouldn't touch the book if it were twice, let alone three or four times as long.
And, again, something worth reading...
and sharing ....
and recommending ....
and dwelling on (and thinking about)....
and discussing/talking about....
and (as suggested above) passing on ... to a friend or a colleague or a family member.
If the book has a simple thesis, it could be anything from: No, it's not a dream, and when you wake up, things won't be better. Or ... Just because everyone said ""it's no big deal"" doesn't mean they're right... Or ... You can stick your head in the sand, but you shouldn't. ... Or ... Normalization and/or denial may make you feel better, but neither is the right thing to do, and complicity is both dangerous and morally bankrupt .... Or ... There's a fine line between, on the one hand, hysteria and over-reaction and the point of no return, and, sadly, the tipping point won't come with a neon orange label and an ear-splitting siren.... or...
And therein lies the rub. If you're someone who reads broadly and thinks critically - and if you're the kind of person who will read this, you're already anxious enough. If you're the kind of person who scoffs at a serious, thoughtful, eye-opening critique of the current state of affairs, the odds are low you'll read this book, let alone be open to its message.
So, as short, mainstream non-fiction, written by hard-core academics go, this is pretty unique stuff. As one of my colleagues said: ""I appreciate how well [the author] simplified years of learning to make it widely available.""
The book was worth writing, and it's definitely worth reading. I hope that many (many) read it and share it. (less)",Positif
,"Young Adult, Contemporary, Romance",Surina,"Okay, so this book? The perfect beach read. I couldnâ€™t put it down. Honestly, I looked at the blurb for this and was like â€œMeh.â€ I mean, it sounded super cliche and over-the-top romance-y. But even though I low-key hate cliches, I always have to buy books like these just in case there are hidden gems out there.
I hit a jackpot. Jenn Bennett somehow managed to spin straw (aka an overdone cliche) into gold with her words.
Bailey and I hit off immediately. Her inner monologue is kind of dramatic, but not to the point where itâ€™s annoying â€“ itâ€™s actually fun and enjoyable to read. I was laughing out loud at some points. And feeling this weird, parently pride. See, at the beginning of the book, Baileyâ€™s what we call an evader. (She prefers the term â€œArtful Dodgerâ€.) She doesnâ€™t like getting noticed or put in the spotlight. She grows a lot through the course of the novel, and she starts putting herself out there, and learning to be honest. Itâ€™s really touching to read about. Like, I feel privileged that I got to experience everything that helped her grow into the person she is by the end of the book.
Also, I love her mentality with food.
â€œI make a decision to give up on everything: finding Alex, finding another job, the meaning of life. Just give me that sweet fried dough.â€
I see so much of myself in this sentence.
And of course, Bailey has excellent taste, because the sweet fried dough in question are churros, the most amazing desert ever. I love this girl.
Also, Porter. Porter, Porter, Porter. What a guy. So, if you read the blurb, you know that Porter is Alex. And you also know that Bailey doesnâ€™t know Porter is Alex and that Porter doesnâ€™t know that Bailey is Mink.
Umâ€¦guys, do you know what this is?!
This. Is. Brilliant!
Seriously, I love the concept. THINK OF ALL THE CONFUSION AND PAIN THE CHARACTERS GO THROUGH. Gimme all the books like this! I want to see my characters hurt before the happy ending! (MWAH HA HA HA.) I kept seeing all the clues in the book â€“ they werenâ€™t obvious to Bailey in the beginning, but it was REALLY obvious towards the end â€“ and it was kind of frustrating, because I wanted to yell at her to pay attention to what was going on and FIGURE IT OUT ALREADY.
Oh man, I totally digressed. Alright, back on topic: Porter. Heâ€™s cut from the same cloth as most of the guys in YA fiction: total bad boy, kind of a jerk to our MC at first, and has had a rough experience in his past. So a cliche. Jenn Bennet still manages to make him work.
She also makes Bailey's relationship with him work as well. Bailey and Porter are perfect for each other because a) Bailey also experienced a traumatic event and b) they are â€“ in their own words â€“ â€œcompatible arguersâ€.
Hehe. Love that expression.
Iâ€™m not saying anything about the traumatic events, because theyâ€™re both revealed in moments that are turning points in Porter and Baileyâ€™s relationship. I fell like saying anything would take away from this, so Iâ€™ll keep my big mouth shut for the people that decide to read it. But lemme just say, whoa. I cannot believe some of this stuff happened. And Jeez, poor Porter and Bailey.
Speaking of Porter and Bailey, you can tell theyâ€™re in love by page 55.
â€œPorter Roth. Beautiful body. Head full of wild curls. Cocky smile.
My archnemesis.â€
Awwwwwwâ€¦they love each other!
Theyâ€™re relationship progresses naturally and slowly. And they are really cute. Too cute.
On a completely on related note, this book is surprisingly action-packed for a YA novel. Porter and Bailey literally stop a ROBBERY. Our main character tackled the perp to the ground. *high fives Bailey* God, why canâ€™t all YA contemporary be like this?
You know another thing YA contemporary should have? Strong female friendships. Like in this book. Grace and Bailey develop a strong friendship because they work in the Hotbox aka the ticket counter aka the worst job at the museum. And this book â€“ instead of just focusing on the romance â€“ gives Grace some action too. Thereâ€™s development in her friendship with Bailey and she also somewhat coaxes Bailey out of her Artful Dodger shell. Go Grace!
Thereâ€™s a ton of drama towards the ending, but nothing too bad happens. (I wouldâ€™ve rioted if my beautiful children got a Fault in Our Stars ending.) The endingâ€™s actually kind of fitting. I wonâ€™t say too much, because thatâ€™s dangerous spoiler territory since the book was kind of building up to that moment, but itâ€™s very satisfying.

,"Fiction, Mystery, Crime, Thriller, Mystery Thriller",Chris Berko,"Absolutely stunning and every bit as good as Power of the Dog and the Cartel. Don Winslow used to write tight little murder mysteries that were super cool to read and full of pop culture references, he now masters the huge, sprawling, multi-layered, ambitious, expansive, intricately-plotted behemoths that seem so real it's almost like you are reading a case file or listening to actual cops tell their stories. This is not a good guys vs. bad guys kind of book and don't go into this if you are expecting warm fuzzies or anything like that, but you will get a seemingly real web of people and institutions trying to hold things together the best way they know how, and seeing as how everyone is human, mistakes will be made.

,"Autobiography, Memoir, Nonfiction, Humor, Biography, History ",Peter Mcloughlin,"This book was a pleasurable indulgence in childhood nostalgia. I can imagine this book is popular with people born between 1963 and 1973. The book is about the author's rather pleasant childhood in a prosperous intact fairly well balanced nuclear family. If it wasn't full of props and references from the 1970s that most mod of decades, you'd think it was a memoir of a 1950s childhood. I am giving this book four stars because even though it is indulgent with its nostalgia, it evokes the decade so well that it makes people of a certain age nod their heads. I couldn't help but like it despite myself. Towards the end of the book, the narrative changes mood from the summerlike hang-loose childhood of the seventies to the more frosty adolescence of the 1980s with its nuclear winter of nightmares which makes for a jarring transition which again people of certain age can definitely relate to.

,"Young Adult, Contemporary, Health, Mental Health, Mental Illness, Fiction",Masooma,"I prefer â€œcrazyâ€ to â€œmentally ill.â€ Sounds more dignified.
Words on Bathroom Walls is a really good read about a schizophrenic child who talks to the reader via journal entries to his therapist. The main character is a sweetheart and he explains his condition in with such a vivid manner that you can understand what heâ€™s going through.
Basically, the novel portrays the ugly side of his mental illness. In that, Adam describes the searing intensity of other peopleâ€™s hatred for him, their fear of such a kid patient, and the weight of expectations to behave well. But, Adam tells us thatâ€™s not how his brain works, thereâ€™s no switch that he can flip to reality or live with the hallucinations.
Itâ€™s a very strange reality when you canâ€™t trust yourself. Thereâ€™s no foundation for anything. The faith that I might have had in normal things like gravity or logic or love is gone because my mind might not be reading them correctly. You canâ€™t possibly know what it means to doubt everything. To walk into a room full of people and pretend that itâ€™s empty because youâ€™re not actually sure if it is or not.
Adam takes us on his troublesome journey that is a blend of the reality and his mindâ€™s creations. The only, tricky part is that you wonâ€™t be sure if anything that Adam sees is real or imaginary because you see things through his lens, which is what makes this novel so interesting.
The novel is a short read with the plot steadily unfolding with each turn of the page. It took me only two sittings to finish this one. So, if youâ€™re into this bookâ€™s subject-matter, donâ€™t hesitate before picking it up. Itâ€™s a satisfying read.

However, the book should have some redeeming features to it-at a minimum it should be engaging or entertaining. In my opinion , this story falls woefully short in many respects and leaves the reader thinking surely he or she has something better to do with his or her time.
The story focuses on two women, Flannery and Anne. Anne is a bit older than Flannery and has served as her mentor when Flannery was at college developing as a writer. They become lovers and then abruptly separate with each returning to a heterosexual relationship. It seems inevitable that both of them will reunite at some point in the future and that opportunity presents itself at a writers conference.
Just because a story is set in academia doesn't make it well written. Just because every second page the author inserts a complex word or phrase does not make it well written.

,"Nonfiction, Feminism, Writing, Essays",Eilonwy,"Usually I'm a bit tongue-tied (finger-tied?) when it comes to reviewing non-fiction books.
But not this one.
I wasn't sure what to expect from a collection of feminist essays aimed at YA readers (although I've followed Kelly Jensen around online for years, so I trusted her to make something terrific). This book lived up to all my hopes for it, and more. It's feminist and also highly intersectional, with contributions from white women, white men, POC women, POC men, transwomen and one transman, able women and disabled women. Which makes it look possibly preachy as I type this, but it's not at all. Each of the essays is deeply personal, addressing one person's experiences in the world. Some of them are solemn in tone while others go for humor. Some of them are just plain fun (""A Guide to Being a Teenage Superheroine."")
They all speak to how much better a world we can make if we allow people to be themselves; if we view everyone as a worthy individual rather than as ""a woman,"" ""a man,"" ""a black person,"" ""an Asian kid,"" ""a fat chick,"" or ""that girl in a wheelchair,"" etc.; if we encourage everyone's potential instead of trying to put people in boxes; if we offer everyone we encounter the respect and privilege we'd like to be offered ourselves. (Why is this so hard? And why is there so much resistance to something so seemingly simple? Sigh.)
I'd recommend this book to everyone, regardless of whether you think of yourself as a ""feminist"" or not; whether you identify as female, or not; and whether you're a teen, or not. It's full of interesting people and interesting thoughts, and will expand the way you look at and understand other people, and maybe yourself, too.

Hunter Cross and Emerson were high school lovers. Hunter proposed, Emerson said no and fled town. Neither thought they'd ever see each other again. Hunter stayed working on Cross Farms all 12 years and loved it and the small town he lived in. Emerson worked as a physical therapist for the Las Vegas Lightning football team (fictional) and was dating one of the star players. Something happened that forces Emerson to move back home after she broke up with her boyfriend and left the team. Now she's back in their small town and trying to start a successful physical therapy practice.
Hunter was working on the farm with his brother and took a half fall that he stopped with his arm and ended up hurting his shoulder. The injury brings him face-to-face with the one who got away, Emerson, and it brings her face-to-face with her very first client since opening her practice in the back of Dr. Norris's practice.
From the get go you know they have this intense spark between them and you know they are going to spend the whole time doing this whole push-pull thing that people do. It's what people do when they feel something intense but are so afraid of being rejected, so afraid of being hurt, so afraid of the other person not feeling the same way....that they create a series of pushes and pulls before they either give in or don't.
What if? What if you and your high school sweetheart that you never got over could rekindle that romance?
This is the story of that journey and it is beautiful.
It reminds me of the movies Sweet Home Alabama and Hope Floats.
Dara Rosenberg does a lovely job of narrating. I found her voice to be very soothing and very easy to listen to. I would definitely listen to other books she narrates.

,"Fiction, Mystery, Thriller, Crime, Audiobook",Matt,"Back with another new novel, John Grisham seeks to expand his horizons with a story free of much legalese, but with the slightest hint of some criminal activity. A heist at one of Princeton's libraries puts a number of original F. Scott Fitzgerald's manuscripts in the hands of some career criminals. Quick-acting FBI agents are able to scoop up two of the five, but the others are still in hiding, along with the manuscripts. When one is rumoured to have surfaced at a small book shop on Camino Island, the FBI's Rare Asset Recovery Unit pegs Bruce Kabel as being involved and plan keep an eye on his bookselling operation. Meanwhile, Mercer Mann is approached by a private security firm to help with the reacquisition of the manuscripts under the guise of writing her next novel. Mercer has struggled with her craft and is not sure she wants to play sleuth, particularly if it means returning to Camino Island, where she spent many summers with her grandmother. Taking a risk, Mercer agrees to open some old wounds and pretends to be writing, while surrounding herself with the local writing community. Slowly, Mercer begins building bridges with Bruce Kabel, in hopes of learning more about the manuscripts. However, as she grows closer to an answer, Mercer may have second thoughts of toppling all she has built in a short period of time. With millions of dollars on the line, Mercer must decide what is most important to her. Grisham shows that he has talent to pen novels that keep lawyers and the law outside of the narrative. Sure to appeal to a different group of readers, the story offers some interesting insight into the craft of writing the next 'great novel'.
I have long been a fan of John Grisham and his novels, having cut my teeth on his legal thrillers throughout the years. This story differs greatly from those and serves a completely different purpose. While the legal thrillers are usually quite sharp-edged, this book shows a much smoother edge to Grisham's writing. The characters offer an interesting mix, giving the reader a great sampling of both mannerisms and characteristics that complement one another at times and clash at moments to offer some dramatic flavour to the story. One might say that the characters are a lot softer than Grisham usually presents, but the genre might play into that, alongside the intended audience. The plot and setting are also a much softer, transitioning from the rough and tumble heist at the beginning to the oceanfront setting of Florida, where the breeze and sand denote a more peaceful place for the book to develop. One also has a feel of more romance and emotional discovery in this book, where the reader is subjected to Mercer's inner turmoil and portions of her self-discovery as she grows closer to the man she is supposed to betray. Its structure also left me a little baffled, choosing 'chapters' in what are surely part divisions and then chopping up the chapters into enumerated pieces, clearly of the usual chapter variety. I will admit that the book was well-crafted and kept the story moving forward, but I feel it tapped too much into sentimentality and the development of the author's process than gritty legal battles and a dark exploration of the criminal element, which better suits Grisham as an author and my enjoyment of his stories. This book will surely create a stir, both good and bad, for the vast number of Grisham fans. I am happy to have offered my five Canadian cents and will watch as things transpire.
Kudos, Mr. Grisham for another interesting novel. While it was not my favourite, your versatility shines through by penning this piece. I am eager to see how it is received.

I finished this book with the biggest cheesiest grin on my face, I donâ€™t even know what plane of existence that was but there were a lot of corny feelings involved (any planets I can blame that on??). Itâ€™s like I was floating on a cloud or something. I was overwhelmed with so many emotions for no reason and I guess my cotton candy heart just went off!!! I wish at least it was raining so at least I could go stand in it for the drama!!
Ok seriously. I need $$ not feelings *squashes my emotions with my bare hands*
So as I was saying, this book was just so good, so cinematically, tangibly exciting, so FULFILLING TO THE CORE and Iâ€™m willing to bet that if someone threw it off a cliff, I'd probably dive after it tbh!!
Itâ€™s a universal truth that I am actually and unambiguously and inappropriately obsessively 100% full scale high key addicted to reading crime books and watching crime documentaries and having in-depth knowledge of incriminating shit. My aesthetics would just be capsule hotels and forever I can just chill in a padded bubble and read thrillers or watch crime shows
Which is why I was so excited for this book and boy, it did not disappoint!!
what is this book about?
Basically that after reading it, Iâ€™ve decided that Iâ€™m living my life until someone frames me for murder, which wonâ€™t be so hard to achieve since I spend so much of my time alone that if I was ever falsely accused for a crime I would literally never have an alibi. Besides, I wonder how long before a personâ€™s viewing history and library receipts can be used against them in court like, â€œthe defendant has stacks of crime books and had viewed 46 straight hours of crime shows before the murder occurredâ€¦ sketchy, your honor. sketchy.â€
Iâ€™m actually just kidding. Please if youâ€™re connected to me in any way, never commit any crime I donâ€™t think I can deal with the stress of a police interview and if I get falsely accused, I will probably just fucking start bawling!!
Anyway, back to the book.
I honestly donâ€™t know what the hell to tell yâ€™all that won't be spoilery, so just know that I can't wait to have kids so I can make them read this book and realise the repercussions of getting detention (i.e being framed for murder.)
honestly though, this book was just so?? fun??
â€œShe's a princess and you're a jock,"" he says. He thrusts his chin toward Bronwyn, then at Nate. ""And you're a brain. And you're a criminal. You're all walking teen-movie stereotypes.â€
The characters seemed like puppets attached to a string, as if the entire plot was just this girl playing on her phone and theyâ€™re all her neko atsume cats dying because she got bored of the app.
And so?? angsty??
â€œThese murder club meetings are becoming a regular thing. We need a new name, though.â€
I existed as both a teenager and a wealthy 18th century middle aged woman who needs to lie down for hours after anything remotely distressing happens while reading this. Really. I had one foot in a psychiatric breakdown and the other one in unattractive slippers trying to solve this.
But I TOTALLY GUESSED IT and I think itâ€™s due to the fact that I'm morbid and too angsty and I am always aware of all of the worst worse things that could possibly happen at any given time. Itâ€™s like constantly being held hostage by hypothetical situations.....ok jesus fine don't look at me like that, I guessed it by the end but listen, I would've guessed it earlier if I wasn't busy obsessing over a CERTAIN OTP!!!!)
The characters:
I think my biggest shift in perspective has been going from â€œcan I pay the universe a bribe to never send me any of these characters as real life peopleâ€ to being like â€œwow Iâ€™d take care of you and care about you so hard!!â€ So that just goes to show you what a spectacular character development theyâ€™ve undergone. I literally love them so much and it might seem like my whole life currently revolves around them but yes it does!!
Also did I mention that Nate is my favorite?? bc he is, I mean he's the kind of guy you date to disappoint your parents but if someone is willing to throw stones at their girlfriendâ€™s window so she can climb down the conveniently placed tree and go make out in a car, you bet they're my fav.
Okay, thatâ€™s it for my Ted talk thank you for listening goodbye and goodnight!! (less)",Positif

This debut is a fine coming-of-age novel. The story centers mostly on the narrator and his father, a book lover and failed writer. Overall, the writing was beautiful, but at times a bit overly descriptive. The story was mostly a joyless account of dysfunctional family life in North Carolina.
My favorite quote is: â€œIâ€™m not telling you that you have to read this bookâ€”that Iâ€™m going to make you read it. Iâ€™m saying you ought to be the one to decide whether youâ€™re going to read it.â€ (in ref. to As I Lay Dying)

-Because when the publisher sent me an advance copy, I thought ""why not"", having previously loved McCann's fiction.
-Because it's beautifully written from beginning to end -- so many delicious sentences and passages worth highlighting and revisiting.
-Because while McCann purports to provide advice to young writers, he does much more -- his advice is not just for the young and it applies to so much in life beyond writing.
-Because I loved his sincerity and humility.
-Because I felt inspired.
-Because I laughed a bit, and smiled and nodded a lot.
-Because while I really don't have any aspirations to becoming a writer, he planted a seed of desire and inspiration.
-Because there are a few people I need to give this book to.
-Because he says it's ok to end a sentence with a preposition every now and then, as long as you do it knowingly and for the right effect -- mind you, my sentence above was pure laziness.
-Because I wish I lived in a world in which writing so intelligently and beautifully was broadly recognized and applauded rather than viewed suspiciously by many as elitist.
-Because it's short, can be read in snippets, and enjoyed in small pieces.
-Because I will definitely read it again.
Highly recommended to pretty much anyone who is willing to take risks, and who aspires to do anything with depth and dedication.

,"Fiction, Contemporary, Literary Fiction",Â·KarenÂ·,"It's probably me.
This happens to me not infrequently these days. I read a book. I can recognise, intellectually, that it is well written. The concept is an intriguing one - to re-write the Antigone story in an up-to-date setting (and it IS very up-to-date); it has a lot to say about the state of politics in our twittering, tweeting world, in our world of asymmetrical warfare; the characters resonate, the writing never jars, the font is large enough, it sneaks in at well under 300 pages so I can't even complain that it makes excessive demands on my time.
And yet it does nothing. It doesn't move or excite me. After around page 150, knowing how the Antigone story ends, you know, not well for anyone really, it didn't even interest me much.
Part of the problem might be the choice of narrative focus, which shifts from character to character. A good method to show differing points of view, yes, but it creates distance, and a certain regret when Isma ( Ismene, the Antigone mirroring is very well flagged up) disappears from sight. You know, just when you were getting to like her.
I dunno. It's probably me.

As a reader I wouldn't be scared of my review ;)
We're back with the Royals!
And if you haven't read the first 3 books and the 3.5 novella AND you're scared of royal aka king and queen and princess books - don't be - this is called the Royals series because that's the last name of those boys! â˜º And now hurry back to amazon and buy the first book!!! â†’ PAPER PRINCESS
Because Easton's story should not be read as a standalone - it's possible, past things are being explained a bit in here, but it would be so much better to have read the whole series first!
OK ..... Easton's book - it's finally here!!!! â˜ºâ˜ºâ˜º
He's the bad boy of those five brothers. Hm, yeah ok, they are all bad boys. But Easton is his special brand of bad boy. He doesn't care about his last year of high school. He doesn't care about anything. He just wants to enjoy these last moments as a teenager as much as possible.
He loves flying, his brothers and Ella, but that's it.
He tries to enjoy life. Sex, drugs and rock'n'roll. Only without the drugs, because he promised, and without rock'n'roll, because this is not a rockstar romance!â˜º
So what I'm saying is he loves sex!â˜ºâ˜ºâ˜º
And that is exactly what's happening the moment when he meets Hartley for the first time.
He's in school doing non-schooly things with someone who is not a student!
And new girl Hartley walks in on that.
That's how their relationship starts - Easton just wants to make sure she won't tell anyone. But that completely fades into the background once he starts getting to know her.
Which she doesn't make easy .... But he is completely fascinated.
Hartley is not mega beautiful like all the other private school millionaire daughters.
But she's so much more....and he wants her....badly.
But she's not really interested. She thinks he's cute and if things were different she would be all over 'that', but things are not different.
Only we don't know what those kinds of things are?
What is Hartley dealing with? What is she hiding? Where did she suddenly come from?
We - and Easton - have to find out!!!!
But that might not yet happen in this book - those two will get another book soonish!!!
What will happen to Hartley & Easton?
Will there be a HEA?
Will we get a Cliffy???
YESS, WE WILL - but don't worry, book #2 will be with us March 1st!!!!!
â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•â•
Eeeeeeeep - finally Easton's book!
I LOVED IT!
I was so happy to finally be back in that Royal world!
Reed is gone :( at college, but Ella is still here and she's trying her best to keep Easton in line! Lol!
Poor Easton. He never met anyone like Hartley. He just can't figure her out!
It's mega adorable to watch that!
We have so many funny and cute moments, but also moving and sad and frustrating moments.
Hartley's life is very complicated!
And of course some people, aka girls, at school might stir up trouble again too.
Easton and Hartley have a long way to go until we might get that Happily Ever After!
Things are only getting started!!!!!!!
FALLEN HEIR was another amazingly beautiful book in this amazing series.
Funny, adorable, moving, exciting, mysterious - just plain perfect! Run to your nearest amazon for your own Easton - this one is MINE! â˜º
And now hurry EW - I NEEEEED to know how what happens next!

This book wasn't bad. It was surprisingly good, but not good enough. This book was was extremely unlike what I was expecting, which is both refreshing, but disappointing. I liked how we had an extremely insecure and awkward MC and she goes through an incredible character development, but what made this book really suck? It was the plot.
The blurb of this book is an exaggeration of what the book really is. What I expected was an edge of my seat YA Fantasy stand alone read with lots of action, but what I got was a slow ass, boring plot, boring as fuck action and a huge focus on science.
Freya never wanted to be queen. She's just an awkward, clumsy girl who wants to go out and change the world with her discoveries in science. But when everyone at the Kings ball gets poisoned and killed, Freya, the 23rd in line for the throne, now the first in line, must take the duty as queen. She has to win the trust of her people and fix the corrupt court, while also facing a dickhead who wants to kill her.
â—‡I've seen many reviews of people saying how unbearable and whiny Freya was, but I actually liked her character. I don't really see how she was whiny? To me, she was an awkward girl who never fit in the life of the court and royalty. A girl that just wanted to work in her lab and make new scientific discoveries to help people. She wasn't a perfect snowflake and that was really refreshing. I loved how she had to adjust to this life of royalty and how she goes from being this awkward girl who can't even walk without tripping and flinching and stuttering over her words to a strong, confident, and a fair queen to her people. Freya was fucking adorable.
â€»What I seriously hated, was the plot. But honestly, it was good. okay that made no fucking sense. Thisfocuses way too fucking much on boring political shit and so much science. More than half of this book is Freya doing a scientific discovery and having political arguments. It was sOOOOO fucking boring, like I seriously did not expect that, nor did I want to read about it. But if you like political and science-y books, I'm sure you'll love it.
â€»The fuck is this romance. Freya and Fritzy, or whatever the fuck his name is, didn't fall in love until more than halfway through the book. Them suddenly ""liking each other"" was so thrown in out of no where bc there is no development for their romance and we literally know nothing except that they work together in a lab, and THERE AREN'T ANY JUICY DETAILS, THE FUCK. Their fucking romance just blossomed out of nowhere. And I didn't even like Fritzy bc his character was so underdeveloped imo.
â—However, I loved the female friendship in this book. Honestly, goals, there is no girl hate, which is refreshing.
â—Freya loves her cat and literally risks her life for the cat. fuck yes.
Overall, this book had great potential, but it wasn't executed well.

,"Romance, M M Romance, Fantasy, Paranormal, Vampires, Dark, Urban Fantasy, Demons, Sociology, Abuse, Magic",Diverse,"I will start off by saying this book is the darkest of the three to date. Where it goes from here I do not know. If you read both Captive and Sire you are well aware of the affect Matthew has on your heart. It's so hard to review this book and not give spoilers. I know so many want to know what happened after book two ended. The cliffhanger was UNREAL! Well, I won't give spoilers but I will say more answers, more discoveries, and amazing surprises await you in Broken.
Jex Lane has an amazing ability to pull the reader into the story. I wept with, and for, Matthew countless times. The rage I felt for those who hurt him... repeatedly, was fierce. The joy in the brief moments of happiness was like getting a lungful of fresh air after being submerged underwater. Each moment, emotion, situation, and character is so well thought out and created that I couldn't find a single flaw. The ones you're supposed to hate you really and truly hate. There's no maybe.
There are a lot of surprises in this book and not all of them are unpleasant.... I know that's shocking. The torture for Matthew was hard to take and it was far more brutal in this book than in the previous ones. But hang in there. If you thought Matthew was amazing before wait'll you see him now!
Again, no spoilers but I will say I was awesomely surprised at the turnaround of some characters, the revelation of plans, and what the future will hold now. You will not get out of this book without swollen eyes. I will say when it ended, though shaky, I was smiling. Yes, there's a lingering fear and in pure Jex Lane fashion you are left with that, ""Oh hell what is she going to do know,"" feeling.
This is such a marvelous series and I said it last time I will say it again; it's by far one of the darkest, most creative, fantastically written series' out there. I am a full-fledged fan without a doubt and will devour this series if it kills me!

5 'Let me wake you up.' Stars
Loaded with all the turmoil and feels of a broken soul, the swoon of young love, and swagger of a high school jock my heart was certainly fumbling head over heels in love with Meagan Brandy's DEBUT novel!! Consumed and mesmerized, I was addicted from the first chapter and couldn't put this book down until it had been devoured. GAH! O.M.G it was simply amazing and holy freaking DEBUT PEOPLE!! DEBUT!!!
Drama, angst, and sexual tension; it was dripping off the pages of Fumbled Hearts and running down my arms all while being balanced so perfect and meticulously with ever evolving emotions, feels... thoughts and character growth with such intricately woven humor, depth, vulnerability, and pacing that just kept dragging me further down the rabbit-hole of euphoric book nerd bliss. This freaking book!!! It sucked me in and wouldn't let me go and I was quite ok with that!
'That boy crept up on me like the fourth shot of Patron, warming my body from the inside out, leaving me feeling weightless and capable. Completely knocking me off my feet.'
I adored everything about Kalani, she's a spitfire, a no hold's bar chick with an air of mystery that gradually comes to light throughout the story and OH BOY! My freaking heart hurt for her!! But she's a tough cookie... and even though cookies sometimes get burnt, their center is still warm and gooey lol... well unless they get burnt too much... then you just need to make more cookie dough *wink*
Nate or Cocky Jock as I like to call him, likes to get down down down down down down in the sack. He's WAS a maaaaaaanwhoreeeee until Kalani came along. SQUEEE!! Yeah this bad boy, turned good guy is swoony AF when it comes to our girl Lolli! He's literally falling to his knees and tripping over his feet to spend time with her. GAH! I love when the bad boy reforms and falls for the girl of the story.
The push & pull, sexual tension, basically everything between Kalani and Nate had me like OMG *insert heart eyes here*! It's most definitely a roller-coaster ride from start to finish and what I'd give to read this book again for the first time, to be able to experience all the feels, emotions and chills of this slow burn romance all over again. God this hangover is going to suck!!!!!!

Second book pulls out all the stops. Amazing story and so well told . Intense at times and when the author throws in the twist about 40% into this book it really threw me for a loop. Powerful scenes . Amnesia and Eddie were amazing characters. I was hooked. It is hard for me to read stories about severe mental and physical abuse but this one was handled so sensitively. It all felt very real but there was always hope for a brighter future.

,"Mystery, Romance, Fiction, Crime",Allison Brennan,"Some In Death books are thrillers with a race-against-time ride to the finish. Other In Death books are chilling suspense novels where the tension drips from each fast-turning page. And many In Death books are like Secrets In Death: a well-crafted police procedural that has you walking step-by-step with our heroine Eve Dallas as she solves a violent crime and proves, yet again, that she deserves her badge.
After 45 books, thereâ€™s a maturity to this series that makes it shine above most other long-running mystery series. Every book is as smooth as good whiskey, well-crafted, intriguing, and downright fun. Secrets is no exception.

,"Mystery, Fiction, Thriller, Contemporary, Mystery Thriller",Jan,"I'm honestly a bit worried at how much I liked this book.........
It's dark, angry and disturbing. Rich with secrets and flawed characters at every corner. Characters that at once irritated me, then made me want to reach out and give them a hug.
The reader is privy to the 'dark secret' early on, and to be honest I wasn't all that surprised. What did surprise me though was how the author handled this secret through the rest of the book.
Instead of it being smack in your face, there were undertones of it as the story played out, bouncing between Now and Then chapters, leading up to the final confrontation where there can be no more denial. I found this absolutely brilliant!
I think this subtlety allowed me to understand the characters enough to empathize with their situation instead of ruling out the absurdity of the whole premise. It's still there mind you, but the author was able to make me think past it, which helped make this a 5 star review versus a 2 star one.
Adding to the above-I was also impressed with how the author made me feel. From anger to smiles, from sadness to feelings of love and tenderness. Oh-and CREEPED OUT, can't forget that one!!
I'm not going to get into the plot as I don't want to mistakenly give anything away. I hope this review has peaked your interest enough to give it a read. It's a quick one, at just over 200 pages, but reads like one with a lot more to say.
I will most definitely be keeping my eyes out for more from this author, and I recommend that you do too!!

In this life, all of us have our own issues...some more intense than others. But to each of us... they are our Own Issues, so how can we judge whether ours are more than another's...People are not perfect... it would be so boring if we were... It is our ability to overcome obstacles which make us... It makes us Brave, Strong, Courageous, and Beautiful in the doing of it.
Penny Reid has taken us on a journey where the obstacles to overcome are equally immense, intense, heartbreaking and gratifying...but also so very human. She does it in her very special way of lacing a intricate story with our beloved Winston Brothers and with all the insight, humor, pathos and reality of real world life, as only she can do it.
What I love so much about Reid is how she thinks. How she guides us through the tale...taking us by the hand and showing us the way all obstacles in life can be addressed...It may sound simplistic...but in my reality, she does just that.
Reid will give us markers... Quotes to help us frame what we are experiencing. She will give her characters hearts so big and strong, they are able to work through the hurdles Reid throws at them. She also gives us amazingly beautiful nuggets...things that harken back to past moments in the series...
Moments which I will never forget...And by her just giving these references... they do not leave readers who may not have read the other books out in the cold... No, they give new readers insight to the heart of these characters...
But oh, for those who have read every single one of these Winston Brothers Books... They give just the right amount of remembrance... of a moment we had and how profound it was...
Now this particular entry is about Beau... and he has always been the ""Charming"" Twin to Duane's Angsty Twin. Beau is naturally handsome, has that gift of making everyone feel good and wanting to do it naturally...But he also has many hidden layers others do not see.
This is his story and he is dealing with his twin leaving town with his new lady love...It has him feeling off and out of sorts. There is also another thing that has his dander up...
The new mechanic Cletus has hired without consulting him!
This Shelly Sullivan is something else. She is staggering beautiful...more than any woman has a right to be...She is a genius with cars, forging her own parts when necessary and making the cars hum and purr...
But as wonderful as she is with the machinery, she is equally as horrific when it comes to dealing with the people who own these vehicles. This is Tennessee, after all. People are friendly and nice...Not blunt and cold as ice...
Beau is tied up in knots...because as much as this woman irks him...he is also drawn to her more and more...
Shelly Sullivan is a genius... she is a world renowned artist who does huge metal works commissioned by Corporations, Cities and Countries. Her works are amazing. She also can do anything with metal... and loves working as a mechanic. She left Chicago for a very specific purpose and she is working through her own obstacles which have overrun her life.
These kind of issues Shelly is dealing with are not easy at all. They color her thoughts every waking moment. They have kept her from experiencing so much and she is now working very hard to ""fix herself"".
Meeting Beau, seeing him and his way of being so wonderful was not in Shelly's plan...She is a prisoner of her thoughts and she is trying so very hard to stay away from Beau.
Thank goodness for Shelly and Beau... she does not...
Thank goodness for us... they do not.
This is a romance book with a Happily Ever After...but with so much more...
With Reid you get life lesson in everything she writes... but with everything she writes, there is vast amounts of humor, heart, chemistry, plot and wanting...
Wanting from the couple involved to figure out things so they can have their Happily Ever After....
AND WANTING FROM US TO JUST HAVE MORE...
So like I seem to be saying quite a bit these days, please take a look at all the other reviews if you want more information about this tale...There is so much talent out there and you will get something from each every review.
The great news is this series is not over by a long shot... which makes my heart go pitter-pat. Penny Reid has created a family of unique qualities... and I am grateful every time I read about it.

,"Romance, Fiction, Contemporary, Womens Fiction, Chick Lit",Amalia Gavea,"â€˜â€™The world felt like it was cracking in pieces, like weâ€™d gone through a shattered mirror into the fractured place inside, where nothing made sense, where our shields were down, our walls broken. In that place, there wasn't any reason to say no.â€™â€™
This book was quite a departure from what I usually choose to read. It was all in the cover, to be honest. I saw the lovely coupleâ€™s silhouettes and I said â€˜â€™yeah, okay. Bye!â€™â€™ Because romance, people. Not my style at all. But, then my brain processed the New York scenery in the blue background and the title that sounded bittersweet, sad and I said to myself I would pretend this wasnâ€™t a romance, but good old Contemporary Fiction. And I was right, thankfully. Yes, at the heart of the story lies the love and unbreakable bond between two people, but it was more complex than that. Family, choices, priorities, worries over an uncertain future are issues that are very prominent in this book, and reading it was a delight. And I confess, there were two-three times when I was really moved. And a little pissed-off at the charactersâ€™ choicesâ€¦
Many have claimed thereâ€™s no plot in this book. I disagree. Not every novel can have mind-blowing moments, twists and turns. What about a story that touches upon daily, universal subjects and has a quiet beauty and characters one could actually meet in actual life? Sometimes, these are elements that are enough to satisfy a reader.So, we follow Lucy and Gabeâ€™s relationship through the years, starting in that nightmarish day of 2001 when terror struck New York and the world changed forever. Lucy and Gabe make some bad choices and their lives turn quite differently that they had planned. Still, the love they share is strong and so beautifully written that you cannot help feeling both touched and concerned over what the future has in store for them.
Do I believe in love at first sight? Definitely. I guarantee you it exists, and I am the least romantic person youâ€™ll ever find. In this novel, we witness a kind of love that starts as an obsession (and we all know how that feels when we are 20 years old) and becomes so strong that haunts the charactersâ€™ lives and the lives of those who struggle to approach them. Now, such a bond is unique, almost rare and it must be hard for a writer to communicate it to the reader without resorting to clichÃ©s. Jill Santopolo succeeds in creating a kind of language that is both contemporary and beautiful, lyrical and raw where needed. As we witness life unfolding through Lucyâ€™s eyes, we are given a sense of her longing for Gabe, remembering their life together, and the way this pining is depicted is powerful, sincere, realistic, devoid of any drama.
I really, really liked Lucy. She has the strength to admit her own faults and stands for her choices, she has her head screwed together and her doubts are understandable. She isnâ€™t in the least bit selfish, to the point when I know I would have chosen differently. (But this is my personal opinionâ€¦)Gabe is complementing her perfectly, although they are two very different personalities. He had the power to make me really angry at times (oftenâ€¦) I mean, the guy was so wishy-washy and couldnâ€™t see further than the end of his own nose. His choices can be a matter of endless debate, but he is so well-written that he makes us look upon him as if he is that troubled friend or relative who always gets on our nerves -especially at family gatherings- but you cannot help loving him and caring for him. However, Darren...Bliah!!! Yikes!! I do hate him and I cannot lie. You can find me a dozen reasons that are supposed to make me sympathise with him and Iâ€™d still want to punch him. The man is a human soup - I hate soup, sorry:) - and I hate him. Truly! The way he constantly doubts Lucy and tries to patronize her is outrageousâ€¦
The theme in focus isnâ€™t love, in my opinion, but choices and priorities. The great â€˜â€™what ifsâ€™â€™â€™ that shape our lives. What do we want from life when we find ourselves at a point where we need to sacrifice something we love for something we feel equally strongly about? Do we wait? Do we compromise? Do we wonder what could have gone differently? Of course, we do. And these questions do not refer only to romantic feelings, but to anything related to future plans and human relationships. You see? This book is far from a simple romanceâ€¦
I cannot recommend it enough. Read it for the descriptions of New York during terrifying times and times of prosperity and hope. Read it for a beautiful reference to a kind of love that is firmly rooted in the souls of two people. Read it to reflect or reminisce of the past. Perhaps a similar feeling once came your way. Read it because it is a very good book, not light, not heavy. Just realistic and attainable.
â€¦â€¦...and did I mention I hate Darren? (less)",Netral

Paula Stokes has a new book! Eeepp!!
The Key to Everything had me both swooning and aahhh-ing! I've never been anywhere outside the country (I'm from the Philippines btw) so I'm a huge fan of ""travel"" books. This book had such a vibrant setting I wanted to get lost in and I loved experiencing Thailand with Oakland! The female friendship was also amazingly portrayed. I love it! The romance was sweet and definitely swoonworthy. (Not that I expected anything less. This is Paula Stokes after all.) I am shipping Tyson and Oakland so much!
Giving this an average rating though because I didn't exactly feel like the book was unputdownable. It was great but it didn't feel amazing. (This is all just me though so maybe just ignore what I said.)
Still. If you love NA and Paula Stokes definitely put this on your tbr. (less)",Positif
,"Fantasy, Young Adult, Romance",Melanie,"This story was so magical, so whimsical, and so perfect. I was skeptical, because I'm pretty much the only person on Goodreads that did not like The Night Circus, but this didn't remind me of The Night Circus at all. Well, at least the 15% I read before I couldn't force myself to read more. I mean, I can see where people would draw the parallels because of the plot, but the writing in this is much more reminiscent of The Raven Boys or Heartless. The prose is the epitome of lyrical, with descriptions that were nothing short of magical, and I devoured it all with a smile on my face.
â€œIt looked like a storybook come to life. She peered down at bright pointy rooftops, moss-covered towers, gingerbread cottages, gleaming gold bridges, blue-brick streets, and bubbling fountains, all lit by candled lamps that hung everywhere, giving an appearance of time that was neither day nor night.â€
Can we talk about how this is Stephanie Garberâ€™s debut novel? I am seriously shocked, because this is not the writing of a new or amateur writer. She has perfected her craft, and made just a really addictive and impressive first story.
God, the writing was so good. The descriptions were perfection. I understand this might not be for everyone, but this world consumed me and I didn't want to leave when I turned the last page. I know this book is about a magical place, but it truly ended up being a magical experience that I'm not going to forget anytime soon.
The plot of this has a perfect thriller tempo, too! Yes, I've been raving about how magical and lyrical this book is, but I have to emphasize that the pace is fast, too! Each chapter holds a new mystery, and I felt so compelled to never put this book down. Caraval truly is a fast and magical journey that I can't help but recommend everyone take!
Caraval is a magical game that is played once a year. Not everyone can go, but the lucky ones are sent tickets, and once they arrive they are able to choose if they'd like to watch the game or actually play the game. Scarlett has been writing to the master of Caraval, Legend, her whole life in hopes to acquire tickets for her and her sister, and after all these years she finally gets a letter back.
And the sibling love in this is so amazing. My brother and I are really close, and there is nothing I wouldn't do for him. Scarlett's devotion to her sister warmed my heart completely and I loved reading about it. Also, seeing them pick each other over boys is my freaking jam.
This book also tackles the hard topic of parental abuse, emotional, mental, and physical. This topic is so important, and doesn't seem to be in much YA, unless it is the center of the story. So many kids grow up being abused, yet, it doesn't become the center of their life. Seeing Scarlett realize she is not the value of her father's rage was beautiful. We need more books that handle this issue, because Uncle Vernon and Harry Potter isn't close to being the epitome of an abusive relationship. Many parents can be manipulative, abusive, terrible, and it isn't the victims fault, ever.
â€œPeople think no one sees all the nasty things they do in the dark. The foul acts they commit, or the lies they tell as part of the game. Caraval takes place at night because you like to watch, and see what people do when they think there are no consequences.â€
This book does border on unreliable narrative though, because as Scarlett is learning the rules of the game and the magic of Caraval, so is the reader. Caraval is a facade, it might be a beautiful facade, but it is still a facade. The reader is never sure if what they are reading is true, and that is because Scarlett never knows if what she is experiencing is true. I loved the mystery factor and thought it worked perfectly, but I can see where others might not like it as much as me.
And the characters and players in this world are so wonderful! Scarlett was my favorite, and I feel like it would be almost impossible not to fall in love with her. Her sister, Tella, has a good heart and her actions were coming from a good place, but she was a little frustrating. Hopefully, in the next book, my love for Scarlett will carry over to Tella. Julian is the other main character you read about, alongside Scarlett. His character was so endearing and I absolutely loved this story-arc and twist(s). Not knowing whether to root and cheer for him or wish him dead was a unique experience to say the least!
I loved this book. I loved it with my whole heart. I read this in one day; I couldn't put it down. This book is the definition of a sensory read. Please give it a try. I understand that not every book is for everyone, but this book is pretty close to perfection, in my eyes. I whole heartedly expect this to show up on my ""Best of 2017"" list, and I cannot wait to get my hands on the sequel.
I'll be honest, between this book and BeyoncÃ© announcing she's having twins, I feel like the world is trying to ease the blow of Donald Trump's next executive order.

OMG, this book has changed completely my opinion on this love story! I had some issues with Marriage Games but Separation Games was so much better for me. It's definitely the perfect conclusion for this twisted duet!
I loved how Adam and Diana's relationship changed. Yes, now it's Adam who is stopping their reconciliation but I loved how Diana figths for him. She has changed, she wants all of him (especially his love and his dominance) and she is ready to claim his man. Finally I felt the strong connection between these two that I kind of missed in the first book!
Adam had broken me. Heâ€™d shown me my limits of pain, pleasure, and humiliation. Heâ€™d dragged me out of myself, folded me into his will, and put me back together.
â€œBeg to come.â€
â€œPlease.â€
â€œBeg harder.â€
The married couple has out-of-this-world chemistry and it's in every page of Separation Games. I loved getting to see them alone, as a couple, fighting to be together (even though they had many differences). Thank God there wasn't that extreme involvement of secondary characters in this one because that was one of the things that ruined Marriage Games for me.
â€œYour problem isnâ€™t that you donâ€™t love. Your problem is you love so much it scares you.â€
I just loved how strong and powerful this couple has become through the pages of this book! And I loved getting more emotional scenes (even some funny moments!) and also getting to know all their secrets. And the ending! It was absolutely PERFECT! I absolutely adored the epilogue!
Sheâ€™d given me the gift of my true self.
I was bursting out of my skin for her violation, her degradation, and her honor.
So yeah, I am rating this with 5 STARS! I totally recommend reading Separation Games because it shows better the relationship between the main characters and how they fight to get to their happy (and kinky!) place. You can't miss this, especially if you are a fan of CD Reiss' writing!

I think that this is my first Cherrie Lynn book, and I am definitely impressed. For starters, I loved the entire premise of the book.
The book begins with the funeral of Tommy, an MMA fighter who died due to a brain hemorrhage when he incurred an unfortunately fatal punch to the head during one of the matches.
That is when we meet three of our protagonists (well technically four, but whatever)- Savannah (Tommy's sister), Rowan (Tommy's pregnant widow), and Mike ""The Red Reaper"" Larson (the man who delivered the deadly punch).
It's pretty obvious from the very beginning that Mike is pretty torn up about the whole ""his punch killed someone"" thing. In an attempt to gain redemption, he goes to the Dougas family, and offers to help Savannah and Rowen in any way he can. Only little hiccup in his plan was the fact that he is attracted to Savannah. And she returns his feelings.
I totally mirrored Savannah's sentiments-""different circumstances, different time.""
I mean no offense, but her brother did died just weeks ago, and a relationship built to mask her grief doesn't seem very healthy at all. Plus there was the feeling I couldn't shake that the entire relationship on Mike's part had stemmed more of guilt than attraction.
But you do you girl. And that is the only complaint I had.
I loved Mike as a person. He was tormented- sure, but he never let his fears and ill-experiences stop him from doing something. He made a mistake, and was ready to pay for it however he could, and made no excuses for himself. Now that is the kind of hero I really like. And Savannah was a very strong heroine too, she wasn't whiny, too demanding (ok maybe she was a little, but given the circumstances I am ready to excuse her). She owned up to her shit, and showed so much character when she fell in love with the man who in one way or the other was ""responsible"" for her brother's death.
The story in whole was very well narrated. It was told from a 3rd person dual POV, so we get to see more of the key happenings instead of long and lengthy monologues (which is the one part I despise about 1st person POVs). Plus it kept a healthy pace- not too fast, and not too slow.
Despite of the short amount of time of their relationship, I loved how far both of them came and grew as characters a reader could care about. And that ending fight was just beautiful. Not because it was two guys throwing punches, but because at times I felt like I was there right beside Savannah watching the entire thing go down.
That says a lot about the author's writing skill, which was very impressive. I definitely can't wait to see Rowan and Zane's book, because something tells me that's next and it's going to be explosive.
""Stalking over to her, he grabbed her left hand and showed her the little tattoo on her ring finger. â€œFound it.â€
Her streaming eyes were furious and her mascara had smudged around them, making her look half crazed too. â€œWhen?â€
â€œThis morning.â€
â€œYou didnâ€™t say anything.â€
â€œConsidering what you told me about it. That it was there for the man youâ€™re going to marry. Where did you really see us going, Savannah?â€""

If I could give only ONE BOOK RECOMMENDATION this whole year, it would be THIS BOOK. Holy Book Perfection. Iâ€™ve said it before and Iâ€™ll say it again, JT Geissinger is a genius. You know those authors that are underestimated and not nearly enough people know about them or read their books? Thatâ€™s JT Geissinger.
I read Wicked Sexy last year and was blown away. After reading Wicked Intentions, my brain and heart and body are bursting!! These books are the whole package (pun intended). What I love about this book? EVERYTHING. It seriously has everything you ever want in a perfect book. The feels. The humor. The sex. The dirty talk. The amazing story. The words. The dark. The light. All wrapped up in one perfectly packaged book.
I discovered love was nothing like a fairy tale. It was more like a bad poem written in indecipherable meter by a drunken poet who couldnâ€™t keep a job, so he lived with his mother his whole life while writing the most outrageous roadblocks and outcomes, based on nothing but the whims of his own inebriated brain. It had an awkward beginning, a wildly improbable middle, and an awful, painful end. And nothing rhymed.
Love was the worst.
Inconveniently, it was also the best.
Mariana. BAD. ASS. HEROINE. Itâ€™s impossible for JT to write a weak heroine. Mariana is a genius thief. The best. She has a sordid past and was raised to become the best thief the world has ever known. Riddled with secrets, she steals in order to keep herself safe. She meets Ryan when she is on a mission, and she has to seduce him, but the tables turn and he ends up seducing her instead, and THE CHASE IS ON!!!
â€œWrap your legs around my back,â€ I say, panting too, â€œand tell me how much you hate me while I make you come.â€
Her thighs become a vise around my waist. Her eyes burn. â€œI do hate you.â€
I flex my hips, and her lashes flutter. She whispers, â€œI do.â€
Ryan. BEST. HERO. EVER. JT writes the best heroes!! I loved Ryanâ€™s natural humor and laid-back personality. But at the same time, he is a genius. I love all the geniuses!!! Ryan is irresistible. I am just grinning and giggling thinking about him. He is part of a top-notch security firm that is very well-connected. Mariana continues to underestimate him in the book, but Ryan doesnâ€™t give up on her. His confidence. His swagger. His humor. Gah! He melted my mind
He comes like he does everything else, one thousand percent committed. Crying out until heâ€™s hoarse, praising me, making me feel beautiful, like fairy tales could be true and happily every afters might be an actual possibility. When itâ€™s over and heâ€™s spent, lying motionless and panting, his chest slick with sweat, I sit back on my heels and just look at him. I drink him in with my eyes, memorizing every golden line of his body.
Because in some dark part of my heart, no matter how much I want to believe in them, I know that fairy tales arenâ€™t true.
Ryan chases Mariana in this book, and this chase is delicious. Mariana cannot resist him every time he catches her (who could?!). Itâ€™s a game of trust issues. The beginning of this book is perfect. The middle is perfect. The end is perfect.
Are you annoyed yet about how much I love this book?
My work here is done.

,"Romance, Young Adult, Contemporary, New Adult",Aestas Book Blog,"Being young is all about the experiences: the first time you skip school, the first time you fall in love...the first time someone holds a gun to your head.
I've loved Kylie Scotts writing for many years now and so I'm always excited when she releases new books. This one in particular though intrigued me even more than usual because of its unique storyline. The heroine meets the hero when she gets held up at gunpoint in a robbery gone wrong and he risks his life to save hers. A few weeks later she's surprised to find that he attends her new school. He's mysterious and has a reputation as a bad boy but despite his many warnings, she feels safe with him and their tentative friendship slowly begins to turn to love...
""You're here?""
""Yeah.""
""Why?""
""Because this is where you are,"" he said, as if it were obvious.
The story begins with the robbery. And the way this scene was written was incredibly vivid. I could imagine it so clearly. It was just a normal, quiet night -- nothing to give cause for alarm or and nothing that might have given Edie any idea of what was to come. She'd just finished raiding the snack isle of her local convenience story and was leaving with her purchases when a deranged man burst in murdering the clerk and holding her hostage at gunpoint. Terrified, she had no idea how she was going to get out alive. But then her unlikely savior out to be another teen she'd never met before who did everything he could to get her out of the horrible situation unharmed.
""I should have been able to protect you.""
""Don't,"" I said. ""We both got out alive. That's what matters.""
After changing schools to escape the gossip, she found herself face to face with her savior again. He was gorgeous, elusive, mysterious and alluring, but he firmly warned her away from him. It seemed that everyone she met either wanted to be his friend or his conquest and yet few people really knew him. In so many ways, he was her complete opposite -- bad boy to her good girl. However, they were both drawn together bonded by that one night.
""You did save my life.""
The trace of a sad smile flitted around the corners of his mouth.
I pulled myself forward on the bed and gathered the sheets up around my legs. ""Why did you tell yourself not to come here?""
""Because I'm poison."" His eyes fixed on mine. ""I don't want to drag you down... There's no coming back from that.""
Despite the suspenseful beginning of this story, I'd actually describe the overall feeling of this book as quiet and healing. The author did a really great job of showing the aftermath -- both the large ways that such a traumatic incident impacted their lives as well as the more subtle ones - the little shifts in perspectives. Suddenly things that had once seemed so important in their lives weren't. And sometimes previously ignored aspects were now focal. Life and death issues took on a whole knew meaning for them. As did the appreciation of simply being alive and present to live in each moment.
""I found it hard to care. I mean, what did it matter? Life went on; no one had died as a result. The principal said it would go on my permanent record. Permanent? Please. Bullets were permanent. Everything else was temporary.
This book kind of rides the line between mature YA and very early NA. The characters are in their late teens, falling in love for the first time, and experiencing the heady all-consuming rush of feelings for each other that rock their world. There's sex but it's tastefully written and incorporated into the story. Everything is told from the heroine's POV in a linear storyline and the writing is engaging and absorbing. And despite some of the more serious moments, there's a definite thread of humor woven through the story...
""No. We are not drunk-texting John.""
*Two hours later...*
""Is cock splash one word or two, do you think?"" asked Hang, chewing on her bottom lip while she studied the screen of my cell.
""You're calling him a cock splash?""
""Inventive, isn't it?""
I read this book in one sitting and really enjoyed it! The writing was strong, the story was unique, and the characters felt very real. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a different type of mature YA romance to read!
They've also produced a fantastic book trailer (that really seems more movie trailer quality to be honest) so I've posted it down below if you want to watch and get a further idea of what to expect from this book :)

,"Mystery, Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction, Historical Mystery, Audiobook, Romance, Thriller, Mystery Thriller, Victorian, Adult",Joanna Loves Reading,"This was everything I thought it could be and more. Thoroughly enjoyable!
To be perfectly honest, I did not go in expecting to love this book. The first I was lukewarm about. It had a lot of necessary premise setup and backstory and set the stage for a potentially great series, but I felt the promise was better than the story on its own. I walked away somewhat satisfied that I had gotten to read a new ST book, but also wishing she was still writing in my favorite genre, historical romance. But now, and I cannot believe I am writing this, I am happy for the switch and grateful that more will get to experience her genius. I wish there were more books like this, with such attention to detail in the character development and time period. This book doesn't really start with a bang, but it builds and takes you on a journey. It raises your anticipation to where you find yourself waking in the middle of the night to finish it before starting your day. Three hours is enough sleep, right? This is a rewarding read, and I am excited for the next installment. (less)",Positif
,"Romance, Contemporary Romance, Contemporary",MJ,"Just like our hero Tyler Nichols, Lauren Blakely definitely knows to go big or go home. And with The Hot One, she not only goes big, she goes over the top humongous! This is the Lauren Blakely I know and love. The author who brings her very best when it comes to a wonderful second chance romance. The joy I feel as two desperate lovers find their paths, and that is meant literally, cross after 8 long years apart. That Tyler and his Delaney prepare to face each other again, even it means the possibility of getting hurt all over again.
I couldn't get enough of this book. It is as sexy as it is touching. As passionate as it is tender. I fell for Tyler from the very start as he willingly takes time out of his busy week to spend the afternoon with his niece (Clay and Julia's daughter for those of you who are true Blakely fans). Stumbling upon Delaney and making it his mission to make her his again. All it took was one look and I even knew these two would not be able to stay apart.
I love the alternating POV's since Ms. Blakely is one of THE best when it comes to the male perspective. Both Tyler and Delaney never got over the other but the hurt still remains. And although there are secrets neither shared about their prior breakup, you can sense the desperation on both their parts to make things right. There is great trepidation on both their parts to trust the other but it's handled beautifully every step of the way. You get every nervous thought. Every feeling of longing. They are stripped bare for the reader to see.
This story reads like a slow burn but with a time limit. Delaney gives Tyler a week and they savor the joys of courtship, with no actual sex in mind. But make no mistake about it, these two share a longing that cannot be denied. And you feel it with each turn of the page. My heart was bursting with joy just getting to watch as they fall for each other all over again.
The Hot One is more than the title suggests. This is the kind of book that makes me grateful to be a reader of romance. Because honestly, it doesn't get much better than this.

Detective Inspector Helen Grace is a woman who has had to start over more than once. A woman who has had to look her fears, her enemies and herself straight in the eye and who has come out on top every time. The cost to her, and everyone else has been significant. She is fierce, resilient and vulnerable and she is the best of the best.
In â€œLove Me Notâ€ by M. J. Arlidge, DI Grace is back and she needs to be at the top of her game in order to catch a young couple on a killing spree. This time, DI Grace, DS Brooks and DS Sanderson help investigate several killings: a mother and a wife whose body is found brutally slayed in the middle of the road; a pharmacist who is found savagely murdered; and a school teacher whose life hangs in the balance.
Everything happens at breakneck speed, as reported by Emilia Garanita. The danger these characters experience is palpable: Emilia Garanita feels it and so do we. My heart beating wicked fast, the sweat dripping down my spine and my stomach churning - all while DI Grace and DI Sanderson scramble to stop the killers from taking more lives. What goes down leaves it all on the floor and it left me breathless.
M. J. Arlidgeâ€™s characters have made a huge a mark on my soul. Helen Grace is flawed, human and altogether heartbreaking. Strife is her middle name. Charlie Brooks is the only constant in Helen Graceâ€™s life. A best friend, a sister and a conscience. DS Joanne Sanderson has made a lot of tough choices in the past and she is paying the price. In â€œLove Me Notâ€ - M. J. Arlidge works his magic, with a race against time suspense novel including characters who we love. I was all in reading this one with Brenda, Kaceey and Crumb and am glad to say that we all loved this book. Suffice it to say that I canâ€™t wait to see whatâ€™s next for Helen Grace.
Thank you to M. J. Arlidge for creating characters with heart, soul and vulnerability. I love them desperately.

,"Mystery, Fiction, Thriller, Crime",Linda Strong,"Alex Delaware receives a call from a woman who is just weeks away from turning 100. Since Alex is a child psychologist, he fails to see just why she wants to see him. Somehow she charms him into agreeing to see her at the hotel where she lives.
Thalia Mars lives in a cottage, of sorts, and has been there many many years. What she wants is for Alex to answer some rather disquieting questions .. but she doesn't really go into details. She promises those details when she next sees Alex .. the next day.
But alas, when Alex keeps their appointment, he finds that Thalia has died. Suspecting a little more than dying in her sleep, he contacts his good friend, Milo Sturgis.
Once more Alex and Milo are involved in a homicide .... but who would want to kill a 100-year-old woman. What secrets did she have?
A lifetime of crime, corruption, and death seemed to have followed her to her grave.
This has been such an incredible series featuring characters that have grown to be almost family. I started reading this author almost 30 years ago and have never tired of the adventures of Alex and Milo.
Kellerman pays such close attention to his character development ... there is always something new I learn about them. His descriptions are easily seen with the mind's eye. The investigation itself is fluid and the endings are not always easily seen before the last page is read.
One of my favorite series by one of my favorite authors.

,"Dark, Romance, New Adult ",Jen,"I had a hard time rating this one. Part of me was so mad through out this story, that at times I wondered if I wanted to finish it...of course...I HAD to finish though!!! Then I decided it at least deserves four stars because the author got me to FEEL...and feel very passionate about what was happening during the story, that it didn't deserve to be knocked down in the rating because of my opinions!!! I know this is sounding clear as mud...but I can't tell you anything that has happened...I don't want to spoil anything. What I will say, is this one is dark. Actually, the Sins Duet is definitely dark, and it follows the same families in Karina Halle's other series.
Now that I'm finished, I really don't know what to say!! I did enjoy Violet and Vicente's story of falling in love...although; like his father..Vicente did some things to Violet's family that ticked me off. I did end up forgiving him though...however...what Javier did....I won't ever EVER forgive that. I think he should be slaughtered for what he did. Quite frankly, I'm disappointed that there wasn't at least a shred of good to be found in Javier..I was satisfied with how we had left Javier in his series...but now...after Vicente's series...I feel Javier is totally ruined for me. I don't find an ounce of like for that guy. He went way over board, and for that I blame the author!!! LOL
Anyway, as you have probably noticed, I am feeling very strongly for events that have happened in this..and quite frankly I know I'm not making any sense! My head is all over the place about this particular story. I will say, that if you are familiar with the Bernal Family, and the McQueen family; then you must read this..as it is about the children now...and I have a weakness for stories that continue on with the generations. You can still read this duet if you haven't read the others; but I think it just adds to the enjoyment more if you have all of the history.
Even with all of my hate, I will await more stories...I love Karina Halle's writing, and I am dying to have a book about Violet's brother, Ben!!! Hey, the guy supposedly takes after his stud of a dad; Camden McQueen!!! What is not to love?! So, I sit here and wait!!! (less)",Positif

How can such a slim book in page count hold so much emotion? Not melodramatically told, but simplygood storytelling and some emotive prose. Such a sense of melancholy, lonliness, grief and love fairly leap off the pages. We hear from Ellis, and then we hear Michaels story. At one point Michael writes in his journal,
""I'm broken by my need for others. By the erotic dance of memory that pounces when lonliness falls.""
Sounds like words from a poem, and there is much more of those type of lines. This is a story that is both beautiful and sad. That painting, Van Gogh and the sunflowers will have meaning, threaded throughout this story. I would have given this five stars but for the fact that I sometimes became confused with the timeline. This does go back and forth, but for the most part I think it needed to be told this way, foritto make emotional sense. It does end with a sense of hope, bittersweet but hopeful.
This was my monthly read with Angela and Esil. We all loved this one as I love reading with them. We have been on a good read roll lately, hoping it continues.

,"Young Adult, Contemporary, Mystery, Fiction, Realistic Fiction",Lauren (Shakespeare & Whisky),"Some children are just born bad, plain and simple. This is how mary B. Addison became a household nameâ€¦ was there something that made her snap, or was the evil dormant all along?
4.5 Stars
Allegedly is a brilliantly written, well plotted piece of fiction that speaks to deep, dark truths in modern society.
THE CHARACTERS
Mary is beautifully released as the main character. She perfectly incapsulates a mixture of intellectual potential, voiceless exhaustion and clear-eyed awareness of the hopelessness of her own position. At times it was emotionally exhausting being in her mind. I really loved how realistically her choices and decisions were portrayed. She was a poorly socialised, lonely, disenfranchised 15 year old and many of the choices she made, and situations she found herself in, reflected that reality.
She smiled during evictions, smiled after Ray would beat the shit out of her, smiled when we were dead broke, and even smiled during my manslaughter sentencingâ€¦ she was the most optimistic person on earth.
The relationship between Mary and her mother was so well done. Being in an abusive relationship where the abuse is hidden creates huge cognitive dissonance. I felt like this confusion was handled sensitively and honestly.
However, not all the characters were as realistically drawn. In a book about a girl unfairly demonised it is worth noting that much of the monstrous violence of the other girls goes unexplored and unchallenged. Some of the other supporting characters were well drawn, others not so much. What is of note was the exchange between the therapist and the girls. The therapist, an affluent, educated woman, attempts to relate to the girls:
â€œWell, Iâ€™m sorry to hear you say that, Kelly,â€ she says, her voice shaky but determined. â€œBut I am trying my best to . . . give you the emotional tools . . . to help you succeed.â€
â€œHow? By making us write in these stupid books?â€
Kelly tosses her book in the middle of the circle. Ms. Veronicaâ€™s face stiffens.
â€œYou know, even though I havenâ€™t been exactly in your situations, I can still relate,â€ she says, growing defensive. â€œI . . . I lost my first boyfriend, my first love. And I was in a dark place for a long time. Even had to move back home with my parents. But I dug my way out of my depression, went back to school, and found a career that I love. So you see, ladies, Iâ€™m here, almost to be an inspiration. That you, too, can overcome anything.â€
An entire minute goes by and no one says nothing. Finally, Kelly busts out laughing.
â€œWhat is so funny?â€ Ms. Veronica demands, clearly offended.
â€œYo, Ms. V,â€ China says slowly. â€œNo disrespect, but are you really trying to tell me you having a dead boyfriend is like being in a group home?â€
Ms. Veronicaâ€™s face turns red. She starts to say something but stops herself.
I thought this was a really important exchange. So many people who work with people with complex needs come from a paternalistic position. They have very little understanding of the realities of their clients lives and are confused when clients aren't compliant because ""I'm trying to help you"" without acknowledging that, in many cases, compliance with the worker is demanded- to keep their housing, their government payments, to keep them out of gaol or in the hopes of regaining or retaining custody of their children. I was really pleased to see a darker reality of social work. People who go into case work ""to inspire and help people"" are often looking to get their own needs met through client compliance, not the other way round.
THE PLOT
I had my heart in my throat for a lot of the novel. I desperately wanted to see Mary receive justice and was so afraid it wasn't going to work out for her. Unfortunately, I felt that the ending was a bit of a let down. The story was engaging enough- I didn't feel any twist was necessary and it weakened an otherwise very strong novel. The writing was simply perfect. The style was sparse, littered with slang, and felt appropriate to the content.
THEMES
There are some very obvious themes here- racism, powerlessness, grief, the cycle of poverty and crime, media justice and our obsession with murderers. These were handled with a deft hand. Although I was aware of them I was primarily reading a story. Which exactly how reading fiction should feel.
This is a powerful story that reflects some stark realities. I loved it.
Recommended for: Readers who liked Dangerous Girls and The Hate U Give, readers who enjoy reading about sociological issues, people who like thrillers and contemporary fiction. This is not YA. If you usually avoid the genre let me reassure you that it has none of the painful cliches that can ruin adult enjoyment in YA stories. (less)",Positif

Are you a romance Reider? Sure you read some romance, but have you read a Reid Romance before?
In any case, here are a few things you should know about Knitting in the City series.
â–¸Itâ€™s 100% certified happy feels.
â–¸Itâ€™s about friendships forged inâ€¦ yarn.
â–¸The characters are imperfect and flawed therefore very relatable.
Dating-Ish is certainly no exception to the rule, happy feels were found, yarn was fashionably crafted around drinks, and characters revealed facets unbeknownst to them before.
But what is the story about?
Have you ever experienced the rush and anxiety of a blind date? The pressure behind online dating? It doesnâ€™t matter if you didnâ€™t, youâ€™ll feel how awkward and stressful such a date can be and sympathize with Marie, the heroine, navigating through dick pics, fake profiles and impostors until her fateful date with Matt.
But there is so much more to Dating-ish. Unrequited love addicts will get their fill of sweet and delicious angst. The kind that makes you want to take rein of the story and make the heroes together NOW. Penny Reid is devilish and here is why : she set up the parameters of this story so you have no other choice but to be a simple by-stander but at the same time making it impossible to watch the play unfold without vehemently protest. (picture yourself shouting at the book, throwing the book against the wall, shaking your head at how clueless a man can be, cursing the author for putting yourself through such a debilitating state while going through your easter chocolate stash. Oh you ate it all already? You fool! )
Datingh-ish is brilliant that way. Youâ€™ll love it but hate it almost as fiercely. Unrequited love? My favorite kind of romance! Unrequited love between best friends? Even better. And the growing friendship between both main characters felt so genuine, so real, so sweetâ€¦
Gah! All the feels for this strangers / enemies / friends to lovers story orchestrated byâ€¦ robots.
Thatâ€™s right. Robots are responsible of it all.
What if human relationships could be replaced? What if we could avoid deception, heartache by creating the perfect mate?
Thatâ€™s the underlying question Penny Reid is asking throughout Matt and Marieâ€™s journey. Robots are everywhere but would you leave morals and flaws behind â€” everything that makes us humans and individualsâ€” to save you from the heartache and risks of the dating pool? Would you feel more safe with an entity programmed to fit your needs and set with a rigid set of morals? Can intelligence equals emotions?
An intelligence of our own designed to control us all? Donâ€™t you find it frightening?
This question is extremely relevant and interesting in a world dominated by electronics but Iâ€™m probably not utopian enough to wish for such a thing. I think I love the mess of social interactions too much, the surprise of blends too much to ever wish such a thing to become a reality. Perfection is boring, flaws make you interesting!
Through cuddle sutra and professional humpers Marie and Matt are trying to get answers to those questions getting closer and closer while exploring alternatives to the idea of an artificial intelligence companion. And the let me tell you I never craved a cuddle like I craved one with Matt reading this book. The charge of sexual tension emanating from the pages of Dating-ish is positively dangerous.
Worse or better even, the moment Penny Reid let it all go? Not only youâ€™ll feel the relief, but guys, I canâ€™t remember reading a scene THAT hot in one of her books EVER. And that damn saxophone!
To conclude, Penny Reid delivers here a perfect addition to the Knitting in The City series with a romance story like I truly love them, entertaining with a lot of built, a yearning so real you can feel it through the pages, her own brand of humor â€”nerdy robot jokes are everythingâ€” making light of tense situations, a subject to reflect on, the whole thing cottoned in happy feels, yarn and a set of friends you can only wish you were part of. Oh and Careless Whispers. That damn saxophone.
(â€˜Dating-ishâ€™ can be read as a standalone, itâ€™s a full length 100k word novel, and book #6 in the Knitting in the City Series.)

,"Science Fiction, Thriller, Audiobook, Adult, Dystopia, Fantasy, Adventure ",Jackie,"This review originally appeared on http://fictionistmag.com/
I wasn't sure what to expect from The Punch Excrow. I opened it, liked the main character, and then noticed the footnotes and the technical language. This book is hard science-fiction, meaning it places a huge amount of emphasis on being scientifically correct, or at least possible. Once I started reading footnotes, my brain started spinning a little, but I quickly recovered. I'm glad I didn't put this book down.
The obscene amount of research alone put into this book boggles my brain, honestly. And Tal Klein, even while utilizing footnotes that could take up over half of a page, wove his hard science and research through the story in such a way that it made sense to someone with no scientific knowledge. Sure, I was okay at biology and chemistry in high school, but I'm a writer in my 20's, so I haven't solved an equation in years. Unless you count restaurant tips, which I tend to just use a calculator for.
My point here is, I'm not chock-full of scientific and mathematical know-how. But The Punch Escrow, even with all of its terminology and footnotes, made me understand the quantum physics discussed in the book. Sure, I'm not qualified to even speak casually about quantum physics, but I understood the things discussed in the book enough to be engulfed in the world.
Hard science fiction aside, this book is amazing. Honestly. Klein should win some awards. Although, his story is in development with Lionsgate to become a movie, so that's a pretty awesome thing, considering this book isn't even out yet.
And, honestly, I'm going to be first in line when this is a movie. I'm so down to see Joel and JoelÂ² and Sylvia on the big screen.
Klein isn't only good at researching and weaving science into his story. He's good at storytelling. There was always something new happening, some reason for me to keep reading. There were multiple characters to follow, multiple plots and puppeteers pulling invisible strings. There were secrets and surprises and funny quips and re-engineered mosquitoes.
I won't give away much, but The Punch Escrow is set in a time where teleportation is a real thing. Only, it isn't all that it claims to be, and somehow, Joel finds himself in a bind -- instead of teleporting to Costa Rica to meet his wife, he stays in New York. Except, he still arrives in Costa Rica. Because there are two of him.
Joel's smartass narration takes the reader through the whole story, and it's a great one. An easy five out of five stars from me -- good writing, amazing research, great voice. (less)",Positif

,"Nonfiction, History, Politics, Philosophy, Writing, Essays",Andy,"If this is the response to creeping fascism in America, we are in trouble.
(Note: for suggested alternatives see comment stream below.)
Obviously, Hitler is bad. And some of the advice is unassailable (Contribute to good causes, etc.) But beyond that, the little essays that make up this book seem pretty messy.
-Before Hitler comes to power, it makes sense to stand up, speak out, etc. But after, it's more about getting out or going underground. If the author really believes that Trump is Hitler and that Americans have had our last free election, then much of his advice is dangerously counterproductive.
-He says to read books, but Mein Kampf was a book, and Trump supporters love to read lots of books. So this is not a differentiating factor between Trump/Hitler and the alternatives.
-In the first chapter he talks about the Milgram experiments. The finding there was that about 65% of people will obey evil orders for no good reason. So using this as a rationale for the lesson ""Do not obey"" is confusing. A more logical lesson would be ""Be careful about what you order people to do.""
-There seems to be a general confusion about what applies to ordinary citizens vs. what is possible for a world leader like Churchill (Ch. 8).
-He recommends a bunch of books, but it is hard to see these becoming popular manuals for promoting democracy. The Rebel by Camus, for example, is a lengthy philosophical discussion of why it is so hard to get people to rebel against tyranny. This brings up a question that struck me many times while reading ""On Tyranny"": what is the audience for this pamphlet?
-Ch. 10/11 ""Believe in truth, and Investigate"" bugged me. You don't need to believe in truth. The truth is true whether you believe in it or not. Reality exists. You can know the truth. This is very difficult and nobody can do this for every issue, but you can do it for something. And if you're not willing or able to do it for anything then you can just shut up and admit ignorance and not be all fanatical about it. Because blindly trusting NPR or FOX or Clinton or Trump is still blindly trusting. (less)",Negatif
,"Mystery, Fiction, Historical, Historical Fiction, Fantasy, Paranormal, Witches",Catherine â™¡,"Actual Rating 2.5
Hmm...this book is pretty hard to review as well. The first half was painfully boring, but the second half really picked up and got me interested. Either way, this definitely was a complicated story.
The Fifth Petal is a blend of fantasy, mystery, and history. Twenty-five years ago, three women - all descended from Salem witches - were murdered. There were only two survivors: a fourth woman, Rose Whelan, and a daughter of one of the victims, Callie Cahill. The girl was only five-year-old. Then, another murder takes place, and the prime suspect is Rose, bringing Callie back to Salem and throwing her back into the midst of another mystery.
The writing style was okay - there were some good scenes, and some boring scenes, but for this book I really think that the writing and plot were very much interrelated. I've read a few books without plot but with amazing writing, but for this one, the writing had to be supplemented by the plot. In the first half of the book, where the book was slow, I felt as though the writing was flat and boring; it wasn't until the story picked up did I start to appreciate a few memorable lines.
The plot for this was full of twists and turns - I tried telling my friend about it, and it made both our heads spin. With that being said, I did really enjoy how it was done, but when I got to the reveal, I was a little confused because it felt as though the story had previously been going in an entirely different direction. I had guessed half of it, but - and I'm not sure if this was the author's intention - the other half of the reveal was sudden and a little confusing because it just seemed so out of the blue. Basically - I had no idea that that character was even important in the story.
The characters for this were okay, for the most part. After reading it, I definitely still feel a disconnect with most of the characters. (Spoilers here) I really enjoyed Paul and Callie's relationship in the beginning, and I liked them as friends; then they got together and said ""I love you"" and I still thought that was cute. And then he proposed a few pages later and I went:
Other than that, I also felt a little disconnected with most of the characters - I think the only one I understood was Callie.
But this may have been because of this: I've never read The Lace Reader, and although I don't think I had any problem with this book, I do wonder if I would have enjoyed it more with a little more context about who the characters were.
I'm still debating on whether or not I should try to read the first one to see if I can gain a little more background, but for the time being I really don't have the motivation to do so. (less)",Negatif

,"Historical, Historical Fiction, Fiction",Arah-Lynda,"It is not as though I had high expectations going into this. Having never read a Jennifer Egan novel before I was bereft of preconceived notions.
But based on the blurb and certainly on the first few chapters I was eager to continue reading what promised to be an interesting well written story.
Set in depression era Brooklyn, Anna Kerrigan is only 12 years old as the story opens.
She is accompanying her father Eddie on one of his many errands. This one takes them to Manhattan Beach and a far more privileged lifestyle than anything Anna has known personally or ever been exposed to before. But she senses a nervousness in her father as they approach the beach house that makes her uneasy. It is not like her Dad to be this nervous.
The house on Manhattan Beach belongs to Dexter Styles, a nightclub owner who has ties to the mob but whose marriage also opens doors for him among high society.
Flash forward a number of years and Annaâ€™s father has disappeared. America is at war and Anna has found work at the Brooklyn Naval Yard doing tasks typically performed by men. While there she observes the naval divers and becomes determined to join their ranks as the first female diver.
Let me just say this. The stage is set and there is certainly plenty of fertile soil here for the story to take root and grow.
Add to that, some arresting prose:
He saw a second conning tower fully exposed, three points off the starboard bow. The hard right had brought them toward it.. At that same moment an explosion shook the ship. Hatches blew open, and overhead booms crashed down onto the deck. The â€œElizabeth Seamanâ€ shuddered, and her stack disgorged a ball of flame whose orange blaze illuminated everyone on the decks and then floated, crackling like a giant dissolving sun, over the sea. There was a reek of burning oil followed by deep silence as the shipâ€™s engines went still.
Still I never connected with this story or any of its people. They fell flat for me. The story itself switches perspectives and shifts back and forth in time. These transitions were awkward and disruptive every time. It was like patches of story thrown against a backdrop and more or less left as they fell. The pieces are all there, a non cohesive whole, unnurtured, aesthetic less and limp.

,"Young Adult, Horror, Contemporary, Mystery, Thriller",Candace Robinson,"First off everyone needs to contain their horses.

Also, put in Perkinsâ€™ quirky humor and writing which made that awesome as well.
If you were expecting some epic killer reveal like Saw (the first one) or Scream, then you should prob go somewhere else.

,"Science Fiction, Mystery, Fiction, Space, Thriller, Science Fiction Fantasy, Adult, Audiobook, Fantasy, Crime",Hannah,"I have complicated feelings on this and as is customary in such cases here are my thoughts, first in listform and then more elaborated (it feels like I havenâ€™t done one of those reviews recently).
Pros:
- That premise.
- The plot.
- The world.
Cons:
- The characters.
- The narration.
I adore the premise of this: six clones who are crewing a spaceship filled to the brim with cryo-sleeping humans all wake up newly cloned with no memory of the last 26 years and a broken AI and have to figure out who killed them all and what is going on and why the space ship is turned around. I do love a good closed room mystery and the added sci-fi twist was wonderfully done. I found the plot exciting and the worldbuilding mostly wonderful. I loved the way this book created very specific rules and laws and stuck to them. I have many thoughts on the ethics of the technology described.
I was also never bored with this book and mostly sped through it (and I have been having the worst reading month). I found it in places funny and in others heartbreaking.
But. And this is a big but. The characters are dreadfully realized in such a way that for a good chunk of the book I thought this must surely be intentional (I had a whole elaborate theory that is kind of spoilery â€“ especially because it turns out the opposite was true). It doesnâ€™t seem to have been intentional though. Wolfgang in particular did not in the slightest resemble any human being I have ever met â€“ and yes I understand why his backstory might give reasons for that, but it didnâ€™t work for me. There is also a part fairly early on where Wolfgang challenges another clone to some sort of macho test of physical prowess, while they are starving and a murderer is among them. Which is weird in and of itself â€“ but then the medical doctor on board has a thought along the lines of â€œknowing what she did about testosterone this seems to be normal behaviourâ€ â€¦ and I donâ€™t know about you guys, but I donâ€™t think that is normal behaviour.
The narration also did not work for me. We jump between the characters by way of a semi-omniscient narrator but still the information needed is hidden from the reader in a way that did not feel natural and got annoying pretty fast. I think I would have prefered to have stuck with one of the clones, Maria preferably, because she is by far the most interesting character and I think it would have worked a lot better for the story progression.
But, I did enjoy this a whole lot. It was just what I needed to get out of my reading funk and it kept me glued to the page, eagerly trying to find out what was going on. I thought the way the story was structured and the backstories integrated was wonderful. And the world IS brilliant.

,"Young Adult, Romance, Contemporary, Fiction",Emily,"This is a YA book that says that it's centered around wedding planning when it's actually centered around a tragic school shooting. I found it gross and exploitative, but also (inexplicably?) boring. I did manage to read the entire book in one night, but that's because Matt drove to Houston and left me alone in the house, meaning I could barely manage to get up off the couch. Usually after work I lie down and his mere presence shames me into getting up. So, thanks a lot, Matt. This book was bad.

First just a huge thank you for Penguin Teen sending me an arc of this book. You guys are the coolest. If thereâ€™s any other arc you wanna send my way, please donâ€™t hold back.

R.I.P Emi
June 1998-May 2017.
She died doing what she loves. Crying over fictional characters.
I've been dead for three weeks and y'all didn't even notice. Rude. But I'm gonna forgive you if you pick up this book and join me here in the afterlife.
This book is just so awesome? It makes me wanna run into the forest and join a group outlaws. Do they even exist anymore? Do they accept emotionally unstable introverts? If you like action, beautiful covers, girls who are better than you, and some other stuff, this book is just what you are looking for. It's also really informational? Before reading this, all I knew about Samurai is pretty much nothing and I learned so much about their history. obviously, I will never be an expert, but it's nice to read about a topic that isn't taught in schools very often.
The writing is also so beautiful. Renee Ahdieh is establishing herself as a very consistent author which is great and all but she's also incredibly gorgeous so I'm very much intimidated by her entire life. The Wrath & the Dawn is still higher on my favorites list then this one, but this was a great follow-up to that series.
So if you didn't know what this book is about. It's marketed as a Mulan meets 47 Ronin. I am unfamiliar on 47 Ronin, so I don't know how accurate that is. But the Mulan part. It's a pretty good comparison. However, if you are going into this book expecting the entire plot of Mulan conveyed using the English alphabet and paper, you are wrong. It's there, but this book is its own separate entity.
At the beginning of this book, Mariko, who's father is this big bad Samurai, is being sent off to marry some dude she doesn't love. Pretty stereotypical. But when she was traveling to go get married off, her party is attacked and everyone dies. But she manages to get away. Mariko figures that this group called the Black Clan was responsible because they wanted to kill her. So, instead of running the opposite direction like any sane person would, she disguises herself as a boy and goes undercover in the Black Clan to figure out why the hell they wanted to assassinate her.
I'll be honest. The first part of this book is kinda slow. There is just a lot of haning around, not doing much in the woods. But once you prevail into the last part, everything becomes worth it.
Let's talk characters. Shall we? It's been awhile since I finished this book, so I don't remember too many details. But I'll try.
Markio. Can I be her? I want to be her. She's better than you. My only complaint is that she's supposed to be like this mastermind with scientific stuff, but we don't get to see that a lot.
Okami. I wasn't paying any attention to his character, to be honest. I didn't think he would be important. Then Ahdieh went in a direction I didn't expect with him and I regretted barely giving him a second glance. Don't be me. Appreciate him throughout the entire novel.
Ranmaru. I'm gonna be honest with you. I kinda don't remember his character very much? He reminded me of Robin Hood though.
Kenshin. He's Markio brother and he's kind of an asshole. But I'm not really surprised. But I did really love how much he loved his sister? (view spoiler)
In conclusion. This book is amazing and you should read it. Honestly, I don't know how you are reading this and just ignoring the beautiful cover. Except, is it a peacock or a phoenix on the cover? I just can't figure it out. (less)",Positif
,"Romance, Christian, Mystery, Suspense, Fiction ",Amy,"Weaverâ€™s Needle by new to me author Robin Caroll was a very interesting story that I had a hard time putting down. The premise drew me in, and I was curious to see where this story would lead. Landry was a fun character, spunky, clever, and relatable. I also enjoyed reading about Nicholai Baptiste, and that may or may not have been helped along by the fact that I spent the whole book visualizing him as Ross Poldark, because come on; the picture on the cover is the spitting image of Aidan Turner. I found Nicholaiâ€™s past and his sisterâ€™s schizophrenia to be morbidly fascinating and I really felt for him as a character.
The treasure hunting aspect drew me in, and it was interesting seeing both Landry and Nicholai follow their leads to get to the bottom of this mystery. I enjoyed this story immensely, but the ending threw me for a loop, and Iâ€™m still not entirely sure what to think of it.

,"Children, Picture Books, Poetry, War, History, Holidays",Angela Blount,"Originally reviewed for YA Books Central: http://www.yabookscentral.com/kidsfic...
A touching memorandum and homage to the armed forcesâ€”wrapped in a gentle and beautifully illustrated teaching tool.
The premise is simple. A young boy travels cross-country with his beloved grandfather to Washington DC, where they attend the Rolling Thunder Ride for Freedom. His simple-yet-poignant understanding of why they are doing this, and the monumental impressions he receives along the way, are expressed in poetic verse throughout the book.
To be clear, â€œpoeticâ€ is not an exaggeration. Though this is a childrenâ€™s book (with reasonably large, clear font), a tremendous amount of care has gone into the storytelling medium. It begins with an alternating rhyming scheme, but varies as the tale progressesâ€”offering a range between two and four-line stanzas, and the occasional six-line couplet. It even ends with a terza rima rhyme that clinches the story with tender pathos. The cadence is pleasing and rhythmic, creating an engaging experience that both children and parents will find memorable.
â€œMotors growling, roaring near
Crowds that cry and wave and cheer,
Raising flags of white and black
For those who never made it back.â€
Each page is a gorgeous work of art unto itself: Pastels, sepias, and charcoal in an evocatively realistic style, with a stunning depiction of light the likes of which would have made Thomas Kinkade proud. (Nearly every 2-page spread seems to be cast at sunset, save for the final page, which offers a starscape. This ultimately feels both intentional and deeply befitting the subject matter.)
HIGHLY recommended for all patriotic ages--those whoâ€™ve served, those with military family or friends, and anyone who either wants to pay their respects and/or teach their children to honor the sacrifices we hope they will never have to personally understand.
Note: To date, this is the first childrenâ€™s book that has ever made me cry.
It has my emphatic endorsement.
â€œRising Smoke and glowing ember.
Ride for freedom. Ride.
REMEMBER.â€

,"Thriller, Mystery, Crime, Fiction",Mike Sumner,"It's that over-used word again. Unputdownable! You just know when you pick up a Helen Grace book you will need to be prepared for non-stop reading, non-stop action, pulsating plot, short paragraphs, heart-stopping moments (and there are plenty here!) and a race to catch the perpetrator(s).
The two Graces are my favourite coppers: Helen Grace and Roy Grace. Similar styles of writing from M.J. Arlidge and Peter James, that uncanny ability to wrack up the tension.
Love Me Not starts full tilt and just keeps going when a woman's body is found lying in the road. Tragic accident? Or cold blooded killing? For Helen Grace it's another journey into a deadly puzzle and the clock is ticking. Will more blood be shed before the day is out?
Told in virtual real time and spanning just one day this is another cracking read from Arlidge. He really does keep getting better. (less)",Positif
,"Romance, Contemporary, Contemporary Romance, New Adult, Academic, College",Dali,"You might consider this an office romance of sorts. I would classify this as a hooking page-turner, thatâ€™s sexy, original and touching. Vi Keeland comes through with yet another appealingly clever story balanced by heartening moments full of feels.
The first time Rachel Martin saw him, assuming the man her BFF broadly pointed out had lied about his marital status, Rachel pulled no punches letting him know what she thought of his slimeball @$$ no matter how sexy his smirk was. As it turned out though, her inebriated friend had the wrong guy. Thinking sheâ€™d never see the striking stranger again, Rachel leaves without an apology.
â€œIt was him.
Holy shit.
It was really him.
Screwed.
I was royally screwed.â€
As luck or destiny or something in the vicinity would have it, Rachel locked eyes with him the very next day. When she arrived to class. Taught by the absurdly punctual Professor Caine West. Late. Where sheâ€™d be his new teaching assistant for the next four months. Things could not get any worse, or could they?
After that class, they formally introduce themselves and the spark flying chemistry between skyrockets. Their push-pull was feisty, full of innuendo and sometimes flat out hot. Rachel loved pushing all his buttons trying to break his control, and he pushed her right back, up against a wall or desk.
But there was so much more to them than sizzling attraction, they also had an easy rapport and things in common that helped form a deeper bond between them, like their love for music and the fact that addiction close to them had a hand in shaping their lives.
â€œHe shook his head and continued reading, but I caught the corner of his lip twitch. Why did I love that lip twitch? It felt like a little reward of some sort.â€
Vi Keeland creates the best heroes who are easy to fall in love with. Beneath Caineâ€™s sexy arrogance lives an observant, thoughtful, caring, alpha male who carries too much misplaced guilt. Caine didnâ€™t nickname his TA Feisty for nothing. Rachel has quick, sharp tongue and isnâ€™t afraid to use it. Preferably with Caine. I loved their text exchanges, I loved how Caine took care of her, how he got jealous, I loved watching them fight, grow closer together, give in to temptation and finally fall in love.
â€œYouâ€™re that song. I donâ€™t know any of the words, but the tune is so damn familiar.â€
I always have a good time reading Vi Keelandâ€™s stories. Theyâ€™re written with a smooth, easy to read pace.
Beautiful Mistake made me smile, laugh, fan myself with Caineâ€™s deliciously dirty mouth and swoon from start to finish with its fascinating characters and beautifully sweet plot with a twist that cemented their fate even though they had to face a lot of bumps to get there.
â€œThe connection between us had been there from our first meetingâ€”a spark we could step on a try to extinguish or blow on to fan the flame.â€
Beautiful Mistake is a standalone contemporary romance, written by Vi Keeland. This is a perfect summer read. It is told from both points of view with a happy ending.

,"Mystery, Thriller, Fiction, Mystery Thriller, Crime, Suspense",Shelby *trains flying monkeys*,"When I see a new Karin Slaughter book coming out I get all excited. I'll beg and steal (I kid!) to get my greedy hands on a copy. I totally got denied an ARC copy of this one and I think I whined for 2 weeks. (Total first world problems)
I sucked it up after my husband told me to shut the hell up and requested it from my lovely library. Then proceeded to be almost late for work because I couldn't stop reading it.
Two sisters had their entire life changed twenty eight years ago. They and their mother were attacked by two turds that their father had defended. The attackers were worried that since the whole town hated the father so much that someone burned the family's house down and that might make the girls dad come after them for some legal fees. People are stupid.
Charlie (the youngest sister) stayed in North Georgia and now another tragedy has struck in their small town in the form of a school shooter. Charlie herself is in the school when it happens and it starts bringing back memories of that day from years ago.
I'm sitting here trying to decide how to review this book without giving anything away. I'm at a loss (which is totally the usual for me). I'll just fangirl over this author for a minute..I've read Karin Slaughter for years. If someone asks me my favorite authors I always name her as one of the tops. I've not fallen in love with everything she has written, but that's okay...I'll still cut a bitch to get to one of her books. This book was just what I wanted and if you haven't read anything by her I think this might be a good place to start. She does not step away from gruesome details so put on your big girl or boy panties and buckle in.
A couple of my favorite passages that I remembered to mark..
""If you fall in front of those bitches, they'll laugh at you. They might try to do something worse, and I'll have to kill them.""
""Use my cane if it comes to that It's metal.""
""A possum stared at me though the door all night.""

â€œI wonder what that feels like. Loving another person so much that they become a part of you. I thought Iâ€™d been in love before, but sometimes, when I watch my brother and Wes togetherâ€¦ I question everything Iâ€™ve ever felt in the past.â€
â€œGood Boyâ€ is the most recent collaboration from Elle Kennedy and Sarina Bowen and I have to admit, this is the first book I have read with these two authors collaborating. I love their stories so Iâ€™m kind of embarrassed by that. â€œGood Boyâ€ was such a fun, sexy and thrilling ride and I absolutely devoured every skilfully articulated word. If you are seeking your next fun-filled seductive read then you should absolutely give â€œGood Boyâ€ a go, because Iâ€™m sure you will utterly inhale this story.
Jess Canning, who is always perceived as the family screw-up is determined to plan the perfect wedding for her brother Jamie and soon-to-be brother-in-law Wes. Many of you may remember Jamie and Wes from â€œHimâ€ and â€œUsâ€ (which I am yet to read and after finishing â€œGood Boyâ€ it has sure moved up my TBR list.) Jessâ€™s latest career is a party planner, so she seems to be the ideal candidate to plan a wedding consisting of MVP hockey players. Her main concern is to stay as far away from the best man as possible as she cannot afford to have a repeat of their previous steamy one night stand.
I absolutely loved Blake and Iâ€™m still a little shocked at that fact. I expected to not like him as much as I did. Yes, heâ€™s an obnoxious, arrogant, douche but I also found him somewhat charming and a really lovable, sweet character. I recognised fairly early on that he was mostly excited about the wedding, because he knew who the maid of honour was and he was anticipating spending another hot raunchy night with Jess.
I loved the way the relationship developed between Jess and Blake. It was a quite slow burn mixed with hilarious witty banter. One of the things that appealed most about their budding relationship was how supportive, sincere and sweet Blake was to Jess. Jess is at a cross roads in her life, where she feels she is the family screw-up and unsure of what to do with her life; enter Blake who is the perfect person for Jess. They are somewhat different personalities as well, Jess is serious whereas Blake is the jokester and clown if you will, but he really does care for Jess and does a stellar job of building her confidence up and self-esteem which she is in dire need of.
I really enjoyed this story and I believe if you love an entertaining, fun and sexy story, you will too. â€œGood Boyâ€ really spoke to me, because Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ve all been like Jess at one time or another. Where we are so unsure where life is going to take us, but Iâ€™m sure very few of us are lucky enough to have a Blake enter our lives to build us up and reassure us that we are good enough. I absolutely recommend this story to anyone who loves a well written, dynamic story with lovable, hilarious, sexy and oh so sweet characters. If you havenâ€™t read this one yet definitely bump it up on your TBR list as Iâ€™m sure you wonâ€™t be disappointed.

Chickens and Breads
I fell in love with each of these characters so much it hurts. They came off the page, each with their individual identity - flaws and vital characteristics. The realism strung through in this book was immaculate. I would just like to state now, if you haven't already realized - this whole review will me gushing and raving and overall just loving this book. This isn't a review in all honesty. This is a cry for help.
â€œ I didnâ€™t stick around here so long for any of that. I stayed for you. And if me loving you is enoughâ€”â€
â€œIt is,â€ she says.â€
I would bring this book to every single Tuesday show and tell, and I would do it with a big ass grin on my face. My heart is full, my eyes are stinging and I probably should finish writing this review tomorrow - but I cannot go a day more without yelling about this fucking book, man.
If you are even thinking, hell - if you even looked at this book. Read it. I shit you not, you will not regret it. I'm going to go ahead and just say even if you haven't looked at this book - you should read it.
â€œI do it, and I do it well, pouring my soul into every moment. It's nearing the end of the story, even though we're still at the beginning of filming. It takes everything out of me, because endings are hard. Endings are fucking impossible... especially endings that remind me of a girl I'm trying damn hard not to think about.â€
The Writing
Here's a confession: I did not like Sempre. It was a mediocre read for me. I loved the writing though and so I gave it a decent 3 star review. It was a good comfort zone to get into while reading it.
J. M Darhowers writing is soft. It is the soft that make's your heart ache and your stomach flip. It's the type of soft that only certain weathers can evoke in you, or even certain places. Because that's how fucking good it is.
â€œBecause Iâ€™ve wanted you since I was seventeen years old. Saying that is like promising forever. I need a real answer.â€
Heâ€™s quiet for a moment, resting his head on top of mine before he asks, â€œWhatâ€™s wrong with forever?â€
â€œNothing,â€ I say, â€œas long as you mean it.â€
â€œWould you believe me if I promised it?â€
â€œYes,â€ I whisper. â€œThatâ€™s why I need you not to.â€
Here's another confession: There are a total of 234 highlights and notes on my kindle just for this novel alone.
I am so glad I did not go into this book with the mindset that it was going to be another mediocre read for me, but in a way it doesn't matter, because even if I did - It would have justified itself.
I cried you guys. I am not talking a couple tears or a couple quiet sniffles.
There was nothing pretty about the state I was in while reading this.
Jonathan and Kennedy fucked me up. I love their love.
I thought I was a mess after the first few chapters, boyyyy did I speak too soon.
â€œI didnâ€™t say you werenâ€™t fine. I said you looked lost, not that you didnâ€™t know your way.â€
The Story
â€œThe notebook holds a piece of my heart, a piece of my soul, the piece I gave to him long ago.
â€œYouâ€™re being an idiot,â€ Meghan says, popping up in the doorway behind me.
I laugh to myself. â€œI know.â€
I felt the pain. Felt it because this story had a lot of aspects in it that I could connect with a few parts of my life. Be it from Kennedy, Jonathan, The father or even Jack!
I felt the love. Felt it because this story couldn't stop itself from being one that was overflowing with it. It is so much more than just a romance. Going into a league that very few novels go into, I felt the love because I not only experienced it through the characters - but I conjured up some of my own for the little things.
I felt the laughter. Felt it because this story was funny as fuck. 'Nuff said.
I felt the bittersweetness. Felt it because this story can be described that way in one word - bittersweet. It dealed with more issues than I thought it would and once I waltzed my way through it, I realized that bittersweet feelings usually coat some of the most memorable stories in our life.
â€œSorry for everything I did that led us to this point. And I get it, you know, if you hate me. Wouldnâ€™t blame you at all. But I just need to tell youâ€¦ I need you to knowâ€¦ that even when I was completely fucked up, I never once stopped loving you.""

THIS. GIRL.
THIS. ANGEL.
THIS. FUCKING. GIFT.
SHE WAS MY EVERYTHING. I AM INDEBTED TO A SIX YEAR OLD FOR REMINDING ME HOW PERFECT IT IS TO BE JUST YOURSELF.
Let me just get you started on a few moments, where Maddie stole the show. I closed the kindle multiple times and just saw there smiling like a complete idiot because of this child.
1)
â€œHesitantly, I knock, hearing a flurry of footsteps inside before the door yanks open, the little ball of energy in front of me, grinning.
â€œMadison Jacqueline!â€ Kennedy shouts, popping up in my line of sight. â€œWhat did I say about answering the door like that?â€
â€œOh.â€ Her eyes widen, and before I can say a word, she swings the door shut, slamming it in my face. I stand here for a moment before the door cracks open again, her head peeking out as she whispers, â€œYou gots to knock.â€
As soon as it shuts again, I tap on the door.
â€œWhoâ€™s there?â€ she yells.
â€œJonathan.â€
â€œJonathan who?â€
2)
â€œIâ€™ll be Breezeo and Barbie can be Maryanne for you,â€ she says, sitting down on the floor and patting the wood beside her.
â€œWait, shouldnâ€™t I be Breezeo?â€
â€œYouâ€™re him all the time, so itâ€™s my turn now.â€
Well, canâ€™t argue with that logic.â€
3) And After Maddie draws on her dad's cast and both of the loving parents are just having a moment...
â€œYeah, well, real world, remember? You had to know it wouldnâ€™t last.â€
â€œYeah,â€ he mumbles, though he doesnâ€™t seem to like that fact, his attention now on the drawings covering his cast. He traces the colorful lines with his fingertips.â€
___________________
Overall, I would just like to say that this book is not as plot dense as most new adults are with twists and shocks and story arcs across characters. It's perfect with it's simplicity. It's simplicity is what makes it such a complex story in a manner because we are left there with such intricately damaged and loving characters and we see them solve what they need to.
It was a wonderful journey - one that I would wish a lot more people find out about and read. This is one hell of a book and I don't think it will ever leave my system. <3

,"Fantasy, Fiction, Adult, fantasy",Benjamin Thomas,"Thanks to Goodreads and the publisher, Berkley Publishing Group, for a free ARC in return for an honest review.
Stephen R. Donaldson long ago cemented his reputation in the fantasy genre. He was one of the first to break the mold of The Lord of the Rings style fantasy. Iâ€™ve enjoyed some of his stuff immensely (The Mirror of Her Dreams and A Man Rides Through) while struggling with others (Thomas Covenant series). This first book in his new trilogy, unfortunately was a bit of a struggle for me as well, although it did have some fine moments.
The setup seems filled with overused fantasy tropes. Two kingdoms in a long-lasting war. The use of sorcery is rare but powerful. The protagonist, Prince Bifalt, is strongly opposed to the evil sorcery that the other side uses. Ohâ€¦and his side has guns. He sets out on a nearly impossible quest to obtain knowledge of the â€œSeventh Decimateâ€ which negates the power of sorcery in hopes his side will ultimately triumph.
This all sounds like a typical assembly-line fantasy series from the 1980's and, indeed, it felt like that to me as I was reading most of it. Frankly, the book was headed towards a 2-star rating. Donaldson has, of course, written a protagonist before that is not particularly likable in Thomas Covenant and he has done that here once again. Prince Bifalt is singularly driven and does not listen much to othersâ€™ opinions. In fact, I didnâ€™t find myself all that enthralled with any of the characters enough to care what happens to them and perhaps that is why I didnâ€™t care for the story that much either.
There were some good points that ultimately pulled my grade up to three stars, including the last portion of this first book, wherein a philosophical discussion of the current war occurred. I really like the Magisters in the second half of the book who provide a hefty amount of intrigue and a â€œwhatâ€™s really going on hereâ€ perspective. From what we know so far about the magic system, it seems rather uninspired although I suspect when it gets more fleshed out in future volumes it could be very interesting. And being the first book in a series, not much is concluded and plenty of open questions remain. Iâ€™m not sure I will be up for further books in this trilogy, although this foundation can certainly be expanded upon and a good series might result. My track record with Donaldson, however, leads me to think I will likely pass. (less)",Negatif

,"Holiday, Christmas, Historical, Historical Fiction, Mystery, Christian Fiction, Romance",Beth,"I've had the pleasure of reading some unique Christmas reads this year, and 12 Days at Bleakly Manor is no exception! This story is a fun mystery, full of an intriguing cast of secondary characters and endearing leads. I wasn't expecting the slightly spooky feeling to the plot, and I thought the way everything is revealed later, and the connection to Charles Dickens, to be a great way to tie it all together. My favorite part of the story was wondering what was going to happen to the rag-tag bunch of people who occupied Bleakly Manor.
I do admit that I prefer Griep's full length novels; I didn't reach the same level of enjoyment while reading this novella, but I still enjoyed the time spent reading it. I also admit that I haven't read anything by Charles Dickens except for A Christmas Carol, so there may have been references that I wasn't quite getting. Regardless, it was still a fun story, and I recommend picking up if you're looking for a quirky Christmas read!

I have to admit; I was like once I had finished Blush For Me - what took me so long? As I loved Kristen Proby's writing. It had just the right touch of romantic comedy but romance and even better the lead female character Kat was smart as she is a member of Mensa and her parents are Rocket Scientists. The other thing I loved was that Kat was a reader. Kat and her friends own a bar called Seduction and using each of their strengths have a job of their own. For Kat, since she loves helping people and wine of course - she is in charge of bartending. It has been awhile since Kat has been laid and heading to Napa Valley for a conference she decides to make it her sexcation. What she didn't expect was to sit next to a hot guy and completely freak out next to him on the plane ride there and for him to turn up at the conference. One thing leads to another and Kat and Airplane guy spend the week having the best sex ever. Turns out though that neither can forget one another and Mac wants more.

,"Romance, Mystery, Contemporary",CrabbyPatty,"""Risky Behavior"" is a crime procedural with a M/M romance element. Newly-minted Detective Darren Corliss is partnered with Detective Andreas Ruffner, widely believed to be a dirty cop with a drug problem, and IA is leaning on Darren to report any suspicions to them. Not exactly the best way to start a new partnership with someone who should have your back ...
But eventually Darren earns Ruffner's trust and what he learns makes him rethink everything he's been told about Ruffner - both professionally and personally. The investigation and its twists and turns held my interest throughout, and the conclusion is suspenseful and unexpected. And while the romance element definitely takes a backseat to the police drama, I like how Darren and Andreas start to trust one another with their secrets and tentatively begin a pretty steamy sexual connection.
I'm giving ""Risky Behavior"" 4 stars and am looking forward to the next book in the Bad Behavior series to see how their relationship develops.

,"Science Fiction, Audiobook, Fiction",Charles,"I started reading this series and first found it entertaining: We Are Legion We Are Bob (Bobiverse, #1) (my review). I read the second book and then put the series aside. I finally found some beach time to pick-up this final book to finish-off the series. This book is readable, YA, has some good ideas and tech. In places itâ€™s amusing. However, it's part of a series that is too derivative to be interesting to a serious reader of science fiction. In addition, this series ought to only be published as an Omnibus edition.
The author's prose is workmanlike. Dialog is better than action sequences. The dialog can be flip in places. However, I did not find it laugh-out-loud funny. The humor tends to be geek humor. Action scenes tend to be abbreviated. The Bobâ€™s talking amongst themselves consumes a lot of pages. The shifting POV of the Bob-clones was better handled in the earlier books when there were fewer Bobs. I frankly was only able to tell the difference in them based solely on location.
The story is strictly YA. There is violence, but no bloodshed. In addition, the Bobs oddly have no serious interest in sex. Maybe they edited it out of their programs?
The main character is The Bobs. Bobs are a Nerd Action Hero . The Bob-clones are OK. Despite a large attempt at showing the Bobs to be be differentiating themselves-- they're not really very different from each other. The 'other' characters are very thin. Where are the female characters?
Plot is a mashup of almost every SF trope you can imagine: Brain Uploading , Absolute Xenophobe , Clones Are People, Too , Prime Directive et al . I note the author didn't visit The Singulary trope. That one was a tailor made ending for the Bobs. I have also thought, the author took the long way around in plotting out his story to create more Bobs chapters and introduce more tropes. With every new, well-worn trope introduced, there was another Bob or pair of Bobs spawned. I frankly got tired of new tropes and new Bobs. This story also ends the series. All the plot lines are neatly tied-up. Original Bob rides off into the sunset after setting things right with humanity. ( I still think the Mederios plot line was left hanging.)
World building is good enough, but a bit superficial. The author couldnâ€™t go too much into detail with all his Bobs in the air. The Tech is credible, including the astronautics. There are no overt violations of The Laws of Physics. (That is until the Bobs invented the Ansible .)
This series is YA science fiction made for TV. Itâ€™s not even TV-14. The author has too many good ideas and plenty of Bobs to run with them. However, the multitude of Bobs wore thin on me. The series reminded me a of a SF Party Pack where there is one or two small packets of every flavor SF trope, but not enough of the best ones. In addition, the splitting up of the books in the series did the reader a disservice. I should never have started until all the books were complete. The first two books just ended, sometimes in awkward spots. (This is no longer a problem at this writing.) I canâ€™t figure out why this series is so highly rated. Iâ€™m glad its over.
Readers interested in books like this should look into The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet. (less)",Positif
,"Politics, Nonfiction, Race, Sociology, History",Gail,"I read and loved two of Emma Scottâ€™s books before being hired as her editor. I had to read the next four books critically, scrutinizing line by line and page by page, leaning hard on the story, pushing back on everything and basically being really mean, because it is my job.
I sat Sugar & Gold out for scheduling reasons, which meant I got to read this for joy. I worried I wouldnâ€™t be able to shut the critical bitch part of my brain off, but not for long. A couple glasses of wine and I was sunk down deep in the couch cushions.
And I ate it.
One sitting. Like devouring an entire sugary, golden Sara Lee cheesecake with no fucks to give. I stuffed my face because I could. Left brain disconnected and right brain completely immersed. Ignoring it was 2AM and reading for pure pleasure. Lost in Emmaâ€™s unapolgetically gritty, textured storytelling, her gifted male POV technique and her ability to mine the emotional intensity in a scene. Admiring the bold, brash flavor of this tale. Falling in love with the writing and falling in love with my talented friend again. Being reminded how her books are nothing less than a treat, and that she is a magnificent presence in the indie author world that deserves the widest audience it can reach.
I could get used to this. (less)",Positif

,"Food and Drink, Cookbooks, Nonfiction",Claire,"This book is a wild ride, from first page to last. The only thing about this book with which I'm familiar is drinking. Everything else is really out of my league, so this review is coming from someone who probably doesn't fit the particular targeted demographic.
But whatever. Drinking. I can get with that.
Soooo basically: 80s horror flick-themed book of original drinks, complete with film/drink pairings and a simple how-to instruction guide & liquor descriptions in the front. Very, very cool formatting and design; every aspect of this book is dedicated to that grungy, late 20th century horror aesthetic. I even learned about liquors (who knew black vodka exists? Why have I not known about this until now?) and drink-making techniques (there's a lot of gelatin in these drinks which I totally didn't know exists in the world of cocktails until now. Side note, not all of these recipes are vegetarian-friendly). It's safe to say that I learned an awful lot from this darling little book of spooky kooky horror drinks.

,"Science Fiction, Fiction, Fantasy",Emily (Books with Emily Fox),"I liked the book but I made the mistake of listening to the audiobook and it kinda ruined it for me.
Eva had the most annoying voice ever and every time she would whine I would want to throw my phone at the wall.
Also, Vincent accent was completely off. French and French Canadian accents are completely different.

,"Erotica, Bdsm, Romance, Adult Fiction, Contemporary Romance, Contemporary",SueBeeâ˜…bring me an alpha!â˜…,"â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸! Separation Games, book 2 of 2. A marriage in shambles; wrecked by love, lies, lust & jealousy!
â€œI was her companion and her protector. The celebration of her light and consummation of her darkness.â€
Books in The Games Duet should be read in order:
Book 1: Marriage Games
Book 2: Separation Games
In Marriage games, book 1 we were injected into a marriage in crises. A husband, real estate developer and CEO of a publishing house Adam Steinbeck was notified that his wife wanted a divorce. After the shock settled he demanded thirty days with his wife in a remote cabin. What pushed his wife, heiress and President of a publishing house Diana Steinbeck, Huntress to this point unravelled with story along with a husbandâ€™s secret, doubts, fears, deceit, hopelessness, mistakes, villains and jaw-dropping shockersâ€¦
Separation games, book 2 opens up to book 1â€™s shocking and devastating ending. Itâ€™s the riveting conclusion to their game, to a marriage built on lies and omissions. At a cross road, they are faced with many challenges.
â€œI was going to train him to love me again.â€
Itâ€™s an authentic look at the complexity of love, lust, jealousy and commitment. When love is not enough, you have to decide if some things in life are sacred enough to be above the game.
â€œDonâ€™t touch yourself. I own your pleasure.â€
Adam Steinbeck is everything I could ever ask for in a hero. The complexity of his character is superb. Nine words to describe Adam: Alpha, noble, secretive, commanding, ruthless, determined, doting, conflicted and ruthless.
Diana Steinbeck, Huntress is going to have to dig deep to go up against her sadist husband. Seven words to describe Diana: Conflicted, secretive, proud, confused, tight-lipped, naÃ¯ve, prude and impulsive.
Separation Games, told mostly from Dianaâ€™s POV, is a spellbinding, poignant and at times heart wrenching tale of a lost love; confused emotions and inhibited desires setting both Adam and Diana on a journey of self-reflection and growth. It ends perfectly with an epilogue of hope and healing.
Lyrical writing! Addicting plot! Heartfelt love! Larger-than-life hero! 6-star shelf!
â€œWe were no more than bound, no less than gods, creating life from the love between us.â€

,"Short Stories, Children, Middle Grade, Young Adult, Fiction, Anthologies, Cultural",Holly Mueller,"Fabulous anthology of short stories by award-winning authors. I'm glad I bought this book because I want to use a few as read alouds. My favorites were Matt de la Pena's ""How to Transform an Everyday, Ordinary Hoop Court into a Place of Higher Learning and You at the Podium"" and Kwame Alexander's ""Seventy-Six Dollars and Forty-Nine Cents"". I also enjoyed Tim Federle's and Meg Medina's stories. They're ALL good, though!",Positif
